34102,550215,delectable timing there. Just leans on a drive and pushes the fuller length through cover. Lightning outfield but AB pulls it back,1,1.2,1.02,1.2,2,2,40,255,6

34102,550215,cleaned im up. What a strike. What an important strike that is. Too full and Rohit is slightly late on the flick. He is beaten for pace as the ball clips his pads and takes the off stump out. Huge wicket for SA.,1,1.4,1.04,1.4,0,0,0,0,0

28235,550215,"and another! Good stuff this. Hustling Dhawan for pace too. But this one is aimed at off and middle, Dhawan gets his feet out of the way and squeezes the ball to cover",1,5.5,5.05,5.5,0,0,236,172,3

277916,46538,"more respectfully played by Rahane, but a much better delivery by Morkel. Good length on off which is defended into the off side",1,6.1,6.02,6.1,0,0,137,170,6
277916,46538,important stroke that. We have not seen enough of that so far. Rahane just opens the face of the bat and dabs the ball to third man,1,6.2,6.03,6.2,1,1,97,66,8

28235,46538,good pacey stuff from Morkel. Nice lines too. Dhawan watchfully defends to the off side,1,6.4,6.05,6.4,0,0,250,180,3
28235,46538,missed opportunity there. Drifts on Dhawan's pads who looks to flick but is struck above the knee roll. They will get a leg bye,1,6.5,6.06,6.5,0,1,143,131,7
277916,46538,again strays in line to the right-hander. Rahane leaves the ball as the ball drifts down leg,1,6.6,6.07,6.6,0,1,0,0,0
277916,46538,"slower delivery, 126 kph, may have been cross-seam too with the objective to finish off the over. Rahane gets forward and blocks",1,6.6,6.08,6.6,0,0,148,185,6
28235,550215,slightly shorter but wide and Dhawan chops his cut to point. Have to put these opportunities away,1,7.1,7.01,7.1,0,0,234,159,2

28235,550215,"beats the fielder and that is four. This was too full and too wide and this opportunity is punished. Dhawan creams the drive through cover, past a diving AB at mid-off",1,7.4,7.04,7.4,4,4,355,217,3
28235,550215,"much much better from Dhawan. Not a bad ball at all, good length outside off, Dhawan bunts the ball to AB at mid-off and calls immediately. They get it easily",1,7.5,7.05,7.5,1,1,229,201,3
277916,550215,"another single. Good stuff now from the pair. Fuller than a good length on middle, Rahane works the ball towards midwicket and there is an easy single to be had",1,7.6,7.06,7.6,1,1,250,219,3
277916,46538,good shot selection from Rahane. Keeping a tall Morkel down is arduously hard and therefore he chooses the safer option and goes over cover. Just a bit too short there,1,8.1,8.01,8.1,4,4,16,128,7
277916,46538,"fuller than a good length from Morkel but is too wide, may have been an offcutter. Rahane cuts nicely but to point.",1,8.2,8.02,8.2,0,0,115,156,7

28235,46538,"excellent shot, very clever thinking too. With AB at a wide mid-off, all he needed to do was play a routine drive through mid-off and he executed nicely.",1,8.6,8.06,8.6,4,4,226,349,4
277916,550215,drifting down leg and the appeal is withdrawn before it gets loud. Good length and Rahane misses out on some runs through leg,1,9.1,9.01,9.1,0,0,0,0,0
277916,550215,wristily done but straight to square leg. A very Tendulkar-esque shot that. Works the ball from off to the man at square leg,1,9.2,9.02,9.2,0,0,238,177,3

277916,550215,inconsistent lines but the margin of difference is not a lot on these balls. Good length on off and Rahane stands tall and works the ball to square leg,1,9.4,9.04,9.4,0,0,230,192,3
277916,550215,the line is similar but its the difference in length that makes the shot possible. Short and sits up for Rahane to swivel-pull through backward square leg,1,9.5,9.05,9.5,4,4,350,247,3
277916,550215,"another nice shot. Back of a length, climbing on Rahane who arches his back and runs the ball down to third man to keep strike",1,9.6,9.06,9.6,1,1,96,72,8
277916,46538,"better from Morkel. Reverting back to his usual back of a length, splice-jarring. Rahane watchfully defends off the back foot",1,10.1,10.01,10.1,0,0,220,188,3
277916,46538,"well played from Rahane. Morkel sticks to that length, maybe a tad shorter also. Rahane sways out of the line and checks his pull to fine leg. Kept his eyes on the ball as he controlled that shot",1,10.2,10.02,10.2,1,1,286,54,1

28235,46538,"soft dismissal. Loss in concentration there. Slower offcutter outside off, Dhawan just chips the ball to short cover. JP Duminy is surprised as he takes it. But that was a deceitful change in pace from Morkel. After all that pace, he goes slower and full which results in Dhawan going through the stroke much earlier",1,12.3,12.03,12.3,0,0,241,201,3
