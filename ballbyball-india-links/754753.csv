277916,10617,he has finally found the timing! This is again premeditated but he has played that very well. A short arm jab and the ball sails over the cow corner. It was just a little short of length,1,9.3,9.03,9.3,6,6,345,287,3

277916,210283,he has thrown it away! Poor shot from Rahane. Fifth time Rahane dismissed by Finn. He comes down the pitch and looks to whack the back of length delivery over midwicket but the extra bounce means it hits the splice of the bot and balloons towards mid-on where the fielder backpedals and takes an easy catch,1,14.3,14.03,14.3,0,0,231,238,4

253802,210283,he is gone! The extra bounce has done him here. He looks to dab the back of length delivery towards third man but this rises up and catches the shoulder of the bat... It flies high and Buttler takes a good catch behind the stumps. That is an action replay of Kohli's dismissal in the first innings of the Brisbane Test,1,16.4,16.04,16.4,0,0,163,121,8
