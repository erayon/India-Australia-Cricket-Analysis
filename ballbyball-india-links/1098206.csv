277916,391485,"better. First runs off the bat. Full outside off, some swing. Moving away. A thick outside edge to third man earns Rahane a run. Well bowled. Just a little more movement and that's dangerous bowling",1,0.4,0.05,0.4,1,1,84,66,8

28235,670031,"nice run. Overpitched on off, Dhawan drives to mid-off and calls yes immediately. Makes the run with ease. That's India's strength. West Indies may not have seen too much Champions Trophy, but they have to be careful of those singles",1,1.5,1.06,1.5,1,1,246,201,3
277916,670031,"short and wide outside off, Rahane plays with a straight bat, instead of a cross bat. That means, he fends well away from his body. Pushed towards backward point, who dives to his right to save one",1,1.6,1.07,1.6,0,0,116,152,7
