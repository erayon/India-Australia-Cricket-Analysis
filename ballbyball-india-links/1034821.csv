19264,625383,"he's been given lbw and Plunkett has called for the <b>review</b>. Did he get outside the line of off stump? He's well across the crease. Yes, impact outside the line. But, hang on, there's confusion here! Third umpire says to stay with the on-field decision...for a moment the decision is upheld, but then finally overturned",2,46.4,46.04,46.4,0,0,0,0,0
19264,625383,crunched! That's a fierce blow down the ground. Stand and deliver from Plunkett as he drills through the line,2,46.5,46.05,46.5,4,4,162,358,5
19264,625383,"back to back boundaries! Oh boy. This is dropped shorter, Plunkett gets underneath and pulls it down to the vacant fine leg area",2,46.6,46.06,46.6,4,4,298,43,1
24598,326016,"uses his feet, clips it off his pads behind square on the leg side...dives to make his crease as Dhoni tries one of his back-handed flicks of the return into the stumps. He hits but Morgan safe",2,47.1,47.01,47.1,2,2,43,95,7
24598,326016,"beats the fielder this time! Poor line, outside leg stump, it's almost a free swing for Morgan and he places it wide of deep square leg",2,47.2,47.02,47.2,4,4,14,113,7
24598,326016,"over the off side this time, what a finish we have here! Buvi pushed the ball full and across Morgan who sliced it over backward point and it skipped away",2,47.3,47.03,47.3,4,4,347,141,2
24598,326016,"round the wicket, full and wide outside off, driven to long-off",2,47.4,47.04,47.4,1,1,238,303,4
19264,326016,"very wide outside off, would have been a wide if Plunkett hadn't walked across and caught up with it...gets a toe end to third man",2,47.5,47.05,47.5,1,1,103,54,8
24598,326016,he can only get this full delivery - which Morgan made fuller by coming down the pitch - to long-on but it means he has the strike,2,47.6,47.06,47.6,1,1,118,264,5
24598,625383,"full toss, just clears backward point! The early boundary for the over, slices over the infield as he swings hard, and that's a fantastic century! Brief acknowledgement. Job to do",2,48.1,48.01,48.1,4,4,331,92,2
24598,625383,"another full toss, a bigger one this time, comes off more top edge than middle and falls into space on the off side. Loses the strike",2,48.2,48.02,48.2,1,1,313,176,3
19264,625383,"super bit of cricket which could seal the deal! Get his yorker in, Plunkett can only find the bowler. Morgan had already sprinted off to try and get the strike back. Bumrah calmly turned, moved towards the stumps and then threw the ball when he was closer",2,48.3,48.03,48.3,0,0,176,194,5
19264,625383,"well bowled again, full at the stumps, driven down the ground",2,48.4,48.04,48.4,1,1,126,299,5

19264,326016,"full and wide, skews off the outer part of the bat towards Yuvraj at backward point...actually reached him on the full, but more importantly he stopped the boundary",2,49.2,49.02,49.2,1,1,108,147,7
308251,326016,slams a full delivery straight to cover on the edge of the ring...they get back for the second on the misfield,2,49.3,49.03,49.3,2,2,275,227,3
308251,326016,"gets under the bat with a wide yorker, Dhoni gathers and it's just one to the total...now the crowd start to cheer even louder",2,49.4,49.04,49.4,1,1,179,144,8
