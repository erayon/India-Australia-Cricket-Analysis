This one was too full and right in the slot for him to swing across the line, and he got enough bat on it as the ball sailed over the stands at long-on. <b> That's a century on ODI debut! </b> Rahul lets out a roar. He's only the 11th debutant to make a century on ODI debut, he's the first Indian. Rayudu has played his part in the century too by giving him enough strike towards the end.
