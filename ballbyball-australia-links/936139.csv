321777,228622,the fielding has been a shambles in the last 20 minutes and this is another howler! Through the legs of short fine leg from nothing more than a think inside edge by Miller. That's a shocker,2,45.4,45.04,45.4,4,4,126,12,8
321777,228622,"full, very wide, gets the toe end to cover then has to get the dive out! It's all happening. What a match",2,45.5,45.05,45.5,1,1,231,245,4
540316,228622,"heaves a length ball into the leg side, finds long-on and he'll have the strike this time",2,45.6,45.06,45.6,1,1,118,316,5
540316,557298,a yorker which isn't far off getting through but he gets a thick inside edge out to deep square,2,46.1,46.01,46.1,1,1,96,63,8
321777,557298,"full at middle and leg, clipped along the ground out to deep midwicket",2,46.2,46.02,46.2,1,1,44,227,6
540316,557298,"priceless dot ball, slightly slower and it deceived Phehlukwayo as he went for the pull...took a bottom edge and <i>mighty</i> close to leg stump",2,46.3,46.03,46.3,0,0,175,122,8
540316,557298,"what a shot! Anything Miller can do...Lucky goes up and over the off side, a wonderful inside-out lofted cover drive as he's given a hint of width",2,46.4,46.04,46.4,4,4,317,295,3
540316,557298,crunched out to deep cover,2,46.5,46.05,46.5,1,1,326,219,3
321777,557298,"that's huge!!! Onto the roof at deep square leg. A magnificent pick-up shot off his legs with a effortless swing of the arms. But he was offered length which is very hittable. Still, a humongous blow. Bounced out of the ground by the looks of it",2,46.6,46.06,46.6,6,6,43,79,7
540316,379504,"swing and a miss outside off, an appeal for a stumping and it goes upstairs...was the googly. Did he keep his foot grounded? Yes, he's well back",2,47.1,47.01,47.1,0,0,0,0,0
540316,379504,"another dot! Phehlukwayo thinks he can bring out the reverse-paddle-sweep...he misses, and almost falls over. Miller needs to have a word",2,47.2,47.02,47.2,0,0,0,0,0
540316,379504,maybe Miller just said smash it! That's what he's done. Zampa dragged that down horribly and Lucky as pulled it over deep midwicket.,2,47.3,47.03,47.3,6,6,6,213,6
540316,379504,"now he goes right across outside off and goes for the sweep, gets taken on the pad",2,47.4,47.04,47.4,0,0,0,0,0
540316,379504,"now the reverse sweep, a single to deep cover...he's doing it his way, that's for sure",2,47.5,47.05,47.5,1,1,334,184,3
321777,379504,"gets a dot in at Miller as he slaps this to cover, and it means he starts the next over off strike (although it may not matter)",2,47.6,47.06,47.6,0,0,224,204,3
540316,228622,"round the wicket, short ball, he goes for the pull (or wild hoick) and gets taken on the back shoulder...bounces towards Wade and they scramble the leg bye",2,48.1,48.01,48.1,0,1,205,117,1
321777,228622,"full and straight, drilled to long-on",2,48.2,48.02,48.2,1,1,136,326,5
540316,228622,"that's outta here! What a stroke from Lucky. That could be the deciding blow. Hastings came round the wicket, it was on a length, and he just swung cleanly through the line to send it over wide long-on",2,48.3,48.03,48.3,6,6,38,275,6
540316,228622,"goes for the pull, off the body again towards the keeper...South Africa won't care how they come",2,48.4,48.04,48.4,0,1,222,139,2
321777,228622,"over the wicket, low full toss at leg stump, for a second it looked liked he middled this into the gap but it's do the man at deep midwicket",2,48.5,48.05,48.5,1,1,69,265,6
540316,228622,he's done it again! What an innings from the new man. Short from round the wicket and Phehlukwayo effortlessly swivels on a pull turned hooked which nearly carries all the way to fine leg,2,48.6,48.06,48.6,4,4,105,22,8
321777,379504,"full outside off, driven sweetly to long-off...no need for anything silly",2,49.1,49.01,49.1,1,1,252,325,4
540316,379504,and he wins it with a reverse sweep! Gets enough bat to clear short third man and the celebrations start,2,49.2,49.02,49.2,2,2,328,117,2
