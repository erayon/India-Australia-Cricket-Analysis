379143,553800,"good start from Tremain. Full, but not overpitched. Slightly wide, drawing de Kock forward. No movement and solidly blocked.",1,0.1,0.01,0.1,0,0,233,197,3
379143,553800,"this was overpitched. Pushing it fuller to invite some swing. none in the air, none off the pitch. The result a sweet on-drive back to the bowler",1,0.2,0.02,0.2,0,0,185,202,4
379143,553800,"too straight this time, full and straight. De Kock will pick those off all day, all night. Clipped through the vacant midwicket region. To both these batsmen, the top-of-off line should be more outside off.",1,0.3,0.03,0.3,2,2,41,234,6
379143,553800,"129 kph, full and wide outside off. Rather be here than straight. Driven to mid-off",1,0.4,0.04,0.4,0,0,223,203,3
379143,553800,"131.4 kph, full on off. Not a bad line, not a bad length. Yet, de Kock strides forward and shovels to midwicket. Such a strong bottom hand",1,0.5,0.05,0.5,1,1,127,202,6
43906,553800,"superb end. 135.6 kph, fullish on off. Amla stays in his crease and defends with head over ball",1,0.6,0.06,0.6,0,0,167,196,5
379143,446548,"superb run. 131.7 kph, nagging line on off. De Kock plays it with soft hands, by his feet. Calls Amla through, who responds positive. An easy single. Real quality that",1,1.1,1.01,1.1,1,1,160,189,5
43906,446548,"hmm, 132 kph. Good length outside off, Amla goes back to try and punch through cover. He mis-times to mid-on. Early signs of a slow surface? Amla rarely mis-hits",1,1.2,1.02,1.2,0,0,203,201,4
43906,446548,"no, cannot be there. Poor delivery, short and wide outside off. Amla goes back, late transfer of weight onto the back foot but misses his cut.",1,1.3,1.03,1.3,0,0,0,0,0
43906,446548,"better, 132 kph. Good length on off, may have come back in slightly. Worked to square leg, using those wrists",1,1.4,1.04,1.4,0,0,242,173,3
43906,446548,"delectable. This one is timed to perfection. A very similar delivery to the second one, shortish and wide. Amla stays back, all his wight on the back foot and just times his square cut through point.",1,1.5,1.05,1.5,4,4,3,185,6
43906,446548,"good comeback. gets it straighter, towards off on a good length. Amla takes his bottom hand off as he defends, some extra bounce",1,1.6,1.06,1.6,0,0,167,182,5
379143,553800,"too straight again, easily worked past mid-on. Finch hurtles back from mid-on and puts i a boundary-saving dive. Nice work from Finch. Cannot bowl there though. Just easy for Qdk",1,2.1,2.01,2.1,3,3,38,238,6
43906,553800,"oh my. What a shot. 129 kph, overpitched on off. Crisply driven to mid-off with the full face of the bat",1,2.2,2.02,2.2,0,0,136,235,5
43906,553800,"there goes with the inconsistency. Amla waits for the straight delivery, gets it and then whips it off through midwicket with an ease only he can procure. Races away, quick outfield",1,2.3,2.03,2.3,4,4,332,276,3
43906,553800,"good length on off, not a bad ball but Amla manufactures a run by working it through square leg.",1,2.4,2.04,2.4,1,1,331,178,3
379143,553800,"tapped into the leg side, an apparent plan to keep it straight but I disagree with this process. These two too strong on the pads",1,2.5,2.05,2.5,1,1,108,162,7
43906,553800,"too wide outside off this time, not great bowling. A half-volley outside off is pummelled to cover. Lucky to get away with that",1,2.6,2.06,2.6,0,0,115,194,6
379143,446548,"139 kph, down leg. An easy whip off the pad through deep square leg. Keeping it along the ground, good from de Kock. Played an awful stroke last match, easy to get away with it in the Highveld, not in port Elizabeth or here.",1,3.1,3.01,3.1,1,1,50,121,7
43906,446548,"superb. Full on a fifth-stump line. Amla shuffles across, waits for it and then slices the ball almost by opening the face discernibly late. Gets the gap at point, gets four. All class",1,3.2,3.02,3.2,4,4,9,154,7
43906,446548,"tip and run. Full, coming back in towards off. Amla plays it through gully for one",1,3.3,3.03,3.3,1,1,146,129,8
379143,446548,"fullish on off, pushed into the off side",1,3.4,3.04,3.4,0,0,225,180,3
379143,446548,"better I would say. Full on off, a bit of late away movement. Still, de Kock tries to work it through midwicket but that late swing is responsible for a skew to mid-off",1,3.5,3.05,3.5,0,0,213,212,4
379143,446548,an appeal is quickly withdrawn. Good length on middle and leg. pitched outside leg. De Kock misses a routine flick,1,3.6,3.06,3.6,0,0,211,166,3
43906,553800,a half-volley. Australia's inexperienced seamers are showing it. Simple for a class batsman to just caress his drive through cover. Tear-your-hair out bowling.,1,4.1,4.01,4.1,4,4,31,266,6
43906,553800,"still the inexperience showing. Not a bad ball to most batsmen, but it is to Amla, who shuffles across and whips a length delivery on off and middle through square leg",1,4.2,4.02,4.2,1,1,332,201,3
379143,553800,"better. Closer to off, on a  good length. Worked to fine leg, playing it well de Kock.",1,4.3,4.03,4.3,1,1,107,126,7
43906,553800,"okay, can't do much about that. Acceptable. Good length slightly outside off, a nice line to Amla. Sweetly-timed to mid-off",1,4.4,4.04,4.4,0,0,140,215,5
43906,553800,"not a bad change-up. The 127 bouncer on off is too slow to trouble Amla, who has enough time to use his technique to get on top of the bounce and rolls his wrists to find one to deep square leg",1,4.5,4.05,4.5,1,1,324,161,2
379143,553800,another single through square leg. 127 kph. Nice lines to finish,1,4.6,4.06,4.6,1,1,80,173,6
379143,446548,"yet again, so easy for de Kock. Just nudge a leg side delivery through square leg to get one",1,5.1,5.01,5.1,1,1,90,113,7
43906,446548,"135 kph, this is not good bowling. Not good at all. Half-volley outside off, Amla opens the face and times his drive through extra cover.",1,5.2,5.02,5.2,4,4,17,234,6
43906,446548,"much better. Full on off and middle, Amla bunts the ball through mid-off for an atypically quick run",1,5.3,5.03,5.3,1,1,221,229,4
379143,446548,"ah, a dot ball to de Kock. Why? Because it's fullish and wide outside off. Better line to de Kock, driven to mid-off",1,5.4,5.04,5.4,0,0,235,223,4
379143,446548,"good length on off, de Kock works to short fine leg. An ODI stroke",1,5.5,5.05,5.5,0,0,127,140,7
379143,446548,"gone! Exactly where Australia should have been bowling from the start. Pushes it slightly wider, a full length on a fourth/fifth-stump line. De Kock's intention is to score and so pushes at it with hard hands. All he succeeds in doing is chipping a catch to short cover, brought there due to the lack of swing. Against the run of play",1,5.6,5.06,5.6,0,0,224,190,3
43906,439288,"nice. 135 kph, full and straight. Nudged towards square leg",1,6.1,6.01,6.1,0,0,211,192,3
43906,439288,"a big appeal, 130 kph. Thigh pad says the umpire. Good length down leg, Amla walks off and misses a simple nudge. He wouldn't normally miss those",1,6.2,6.02,6.2,0,0,196,131,1
43906,439288,"130.6 kph, good length on off and middle. Blocked",1,6.3,6.03,6.3,0,0,183,187,4
43906,439288,"big, big wicket. Mennie goes through Amla and the stumps are sent cartwheeling. What a beauty. Not sure Amla could do anything about that. Mennie goes wide of the crease, pitches this on off and middle. like most deliveries today, Amla thinks this is coming back in.  but it pitches and straightens and beats Amla's flick to clatter into off stump. To beat a batsman like Amla with a bit of swing, that's a special delivery.",1,6.4,6.04,6.4,0,0,0,0,0
318845,439288,"good length on off, solid in defense. Head over the ball",1,6.5,6.05,6.5,0,0,197,186,4

44828,446548,"oh yeah. Superb. Slightly overpitched on middle and leg, easy enough to present the full face of the bat and use his bottom hand to get it past mid-on. Races away.",1,7.2,7.02,7.2,4,4,263,344,4
44828,446548,"good call. Drags the length back, full on middle and leg. But not overpitched. Pushed towards mid-on with soft hands, calls ""yes, yes"" immediately.",1,7.3,7.03,7.3,1,1,234,198,3

318845,439288,"127 kph, quite close to off. Pushed to mid-on. Not extracting a lot of  movement, the lines are good enough to keep the batsmen circumspect",1,8.5,8.05,8.5,0,0,143,230,5
318845,439288,"nope, that was overpitched. Too full on off, a simple opportunity for Rossouw to on-drive past mid-on. Superlative timing",1,8.6,8.06,8.6,4,4,117,348,5

318845,446548,"ooh, mis-field. Very un-Australian. Full and wide outside off, too much width. Rossouw thrashes his drive straight to extra cover who lets it go through. Trav Head",1,11.1,11.01,11.1,4,4,348,233,3

44932,272450,"oh yes. Another superb drive. Marsh starts it with a freebie, full and wide outside off. Duminy laces his cover drive past extra cover. Too much width, too full. Just easy, even for a batsman playing his first ball",1,13.1,13.01,13.1,4,4,356,224,3
