Good length and nibbles away a touch outside off, Holder's height means that he generates extra bounce. Finch has a weak waft, pressing forward at it, and edges it to lone slip. It actually popped off the shoulder of the bat to Benn. Big lift! He takes it just below his chest",1,0.4,0.04,0.4,0,0,143,131,7
