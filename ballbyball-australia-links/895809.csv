28235,501012,poor delivery. Dhawan is off with a flayed cut through point. Very short and very wide outside off,1,0.5,0.05,0.5,2,2,334,125,2

253802,501012,<strong>edged but just short of slip</strong>. Beauty. Full but shaped away from Kohli who prods defensively at it. Gets thick outside edge which surprisingly falls short of Smith at a wide slip. Great variation from Paris,1,4.4,4.05,4.4,0,0,167,106,8

253802,272262,not a great delivery again. Short and wide asking to be it. Kohli chops a cut to extra cover,1,5.1,5.01,5.1,0,0,117,190,6
