290630,270484,"down the track and he can't get to the pitch of this slower ball outside off. Goes through with the shot, doesn't time it, and it's hanging in the air but agonisingly wide of Bailey diving to his right from extra cover",2,44.5,44.05,44.5,1,1,90,269,5
28081,270484,"full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket, who's right on the edge of the circle, and they run a single. Smith's throw hits Dhoni's bat as he slides home, and he holds up his hands to reassure everyone that he won't run the overthrow",2,44.6,44.06,44.6,1,1,224,237,4

290630,272450,slower ball wide of off and Pandey picks it up early and whips it powerfully to the right of long-on. Smith sprints quickly to his right and stops it at the rope with a wholehearted tumble,2,45.3,45.03,45.3,2,2,279,315,4

290630,272450,"full outside off and Pandey makes a bit of room and doesn't get hold of the big hit over the covers. Skews it in the air, but gets his placement spot on, right in the middle of the triangle formed by extra cover, sweeper cover and long-off",2,45.6,45.07,45.6,2,2,95,292,5
28081,270484,"full, down the leg side. Dhoni misses the flick and it deflects off the pad to the diving Wade, who appeals for caught behind. Good early call from Pandey to sneak a leg bye",2,46.1,46.01,46.1,0,1,200,132,1

290630,270484,"lovely slower ball, back of a length. Pandey doesn't pick up the length, is through the pull too quickly and it juuust misses off stump",2,46.5,46.05,46.5,0,0,0,0,0

28081,272450,"full and wide and this time Dhoni is right where he needs to be. Huge backlift, flat-bats it down the ground, absolutely smashes it and long-off has no chance going to his right",2,47.5,47.05,47.5,4,4,133,349,5

290630,270484,"down the track and Pandey is an absolute genius at landing the ball short of deep fielders. Takes his bottom hand off the handle while chasing the full, wide slower ball, and it drops short of the sweeper cover fielder running to his right",2,48.5,48.05,48.5,2,2,40,222,6

28081,272450,"full and wide, and it's given wide after Dhoni leaves it alone. Harsh call, seemed to be just inside the tramline, though, as Wasim Akram reminds us on TV commentary - the line is just an indication",2,49.1,49.01,49.1,0,1,0,0,0
28081,272450,"bam! That's a low full-toss outside off, in Dhoni's slot, but in this innings he hasn't been middling anything.
