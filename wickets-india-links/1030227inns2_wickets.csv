"hard to play those. Don't look Martin, don't look back. Or in front where Yadav is leaping about in wild celebration. Deserves his moment under the spot light though after providing the early wicket with <b>an absolute peach</b>. It was pitched on a good length. It had been angled it. It had Guptill rooted to the crease, trying to block into the leg side. But the away movement squares him up, grazes the pad and then topples off stump",0/1,226492,0.4, b UT Yadav 0 (2m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Martin Guptill
"pops it to mid-on! Jayant whoops having made his little contribution on debut, picking up the catch. Latham goes for a flick through midwicket, but this back of a length ball has held up on the pitch, and takes the leading edge. I wonder if this was a plan, making the bowler go around the stumps to keep Latham playing the flick and hoping for a ball - like this one - to misbehave",28/2,388802,5.6,c J Yadav b Bumrah 19 (26m 17b 3x4 0x6) SR: 111.76,Tom Latham
"the inside out drive.... straight to long-off! Good bowling from Axar. He slows this down, tosses it up, draws Williamson into playing an expansive shot. Was he looking to chip it over the infield? Was he trying to place it wide of the man in the deep? He fails in both as Jadhav runs to his left and takes a fine, tumbling catch. India celebrate a huge wicket.",63/3,277906,14.4,c Jadhav b Patel 27 (55m 40b 4x4 0x6) SR: 67.50,Kane Williamson
"he's walking. Goes for a cut shot, but Mishra gets a little more bounce than Taylor expects. Only the smallest mistake. But that's all you get sometimes. The umpires check if the no-ball. it is tight, but Mishra's fine and he can celebrate a beautifully crafted wicket. Great work from Dhoni too. One of the best keepers to spin",66/4,38699,15.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Mishra 19 (38m 32b 1x4 0x6) SR: 59.37,Ross Taylor
"googly! Too good for him. It is well flighted. It pitche on off stump, at a drivable length. Watling is suckered into driving away from the body, thinking it was a legbreak. Moments later, he hears the rattle of his stumps. The ball sneaks in between bat and pad. Outstanding bowling.",66/5,38924,15.6, b Mishra 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,BJ Watling
so he didn't have to wait too long for his first wicket. Flight and drift were the key on that occasion. Anderson plays outside the line as the ball drifts back in to trap him plumb in front of middle. It looked like Anderson's bat got stuck in front of the pad as he prodded forward,74/6,277662,18.6,lbw b J Yadav 0 (11m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Corey Anderson
"this is the kind of delivery that would do any legspinner proud. This one spins back in to go through the gate and hit middle stump. What fizz, what drift. Plenty of revs on that as it rips back in from outside off stump to beat Neesham's forward push. The big gap between bat and pad stood exposed, and Mishra drove through. Classic",74/7,355269,19.1, b Mishra 3 (23m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.07,James Neesham
"Dhoni is super excited after effecting a stumping and that, in most cases, means danger for the batsman. This was once again tossed up outside off, Southee couldn't hold back and went for a big mighty heave, only to completely be deceived in flight. He only manages to connect with the humid Vizag air as Dhoni completes the stumping in a jiffy.",74/8,232364,19.5,st &dagger;Dhoni b Mishra 0 (3m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Tim Southee
"he has five! The dressing room is up on their feet. Mishra is lost in a huddle, hiding away from the spotlight until Kohli pushes him out into the open and he breaks into a big smile. It is only his <b>second five-for in ODIs</b> and it came as he tossed the ball up outside off and lured Sodhi into playing a slog sweep across the line. Top edge is caught safely by slip moving to his left, behind the wicketkeeper",76/9,559066,21.4,c Rahane b Mishra 0 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Ish Sodhi
"that's it. The ball keeps low. And India have won the series, with more than half the overs to spare in this game. Axar comes into the attack, fires it in quick on off stump, Santner went back to push it into the covers, but the lack of bounce does him in",79/10,502714,23.1, b Patel 4 (18m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Mitchell Santner
