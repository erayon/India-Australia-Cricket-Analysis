"Mustafizur to Sharma in last three balls: 0 runs, 2 wickets. Loose shot. Really really loose shot. Will Kohli come out to face the music now? Sharma first. Drives loosely at a length ball away from the body. Doesn't come as quickly as he expects it to, and ends up slicing it to point. He is prone to doing this early on, and that is why despite the numbers he is not an ideal choice for an opener",0/1,34102,0.2,c Sabbir Rahman b Mustafizur Rahman 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Rohit Sharma
"lack of turn does Kohli in again. Fatally this time. There is a send-off here. Kohli is not happy. He stands there and looks at the Bangladesh fielders. If not a send-off, at least there is something said to him. First the delivery then. This is an offbresk, short of a length, pitches off, looks easy meat for at least a single to leg. Kohli plays for the turn, the ball not only doesn't turn, it also skids through to stay low. Plumb lbw",74/2,253802,12.3,lbw b Nasir Hossain 23 (57m 27b 3x4 1x6) SR: 85.18,Virat Kohli
"lovely catch. Redeems himself after missing that really tough one earlier in the over. Dhawan is down the wicket again, the ball is slow, beats him in the flight, turns away to take the edge. Das catches it, and doesn't even stump him just in case. Some confidence in umpires' getting it right then? Also with Dhawan you don't need to worry about umpires. He walks, as he does here",109/3,28235,20.5,c &dagger;Liton Das b Nasir Hossain 53 (88m 60b 7x4 0x6) SR: 88.33,Shikhar Dhawan
"Rayudu comes. Rayudu goes. Dug in short, this is pulling length, but Rayudu goes to cut it. Which means it is difficult to keep it down. He is off his feet to try to keep it down, but he has made a wrong choice of the shot. He cuts and tries his best to send it down, but it travels low to point where Nasir Hossain takes the catch. An all-Hossain dismissal",110/4,33141,21.4,c Nasir Hossain b Rubel Hossain 0 (5m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Ambati Rayudu
"and Mustafixzur has struck immediately. The cutter again. Raina hasn't picked it. This is a short ball, which usually means Raina's mind half-stops working immediately. On top of that it is a cutter that has stuck into the surface and bounced like a tennis ball to take the top edge as Raina looks to run this down to third man. The edge is taken through to the keeper",163/5,33335,35.3,c &dagger;Liton Das b Mustafizur Rahman 34 (57m 55b 3x4 0x6) SR: 61.81,Suresh Raina
"huge wicket. Dhoni has been delaying that final push because wickets have been falling, and now he himself falls. The lethal cutter of Mustafizur again. Dhoni hasn't picked it, and he is early into the shot. Ends up jabbing at a length ball, and the ball lobs to short cover",174/6,28081,39.3,c Soumya Sarkar b Mustafizur Rahman 47 (112m 75b 3x4 0x6) SR: 62.66,MS Dhoni
"he is on a hat-trick. Axar has a golden duck. Bangladesh on fire. 25000 people on their feet. Smart bowling. First ball to a new batsman in pressure situation? Straight. On middle stump. And this is a seam-up delivery. Pitches just outside off, angling in towards middle, Axar plays across the line for his third duck in his last four innings",174/7,554691,39.4,lbw b Mustafizur Rahman 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Axar Patel
"Ashwin is walking. There is a five-for for Mustafizur. They have all surrounded him in jubilation. Only the second bowler after Brian Vittori to take five-fors in his first two ODIs. Another offcutter. It is a length ball, dips a little, and Ashwin is pushing at it in front of his body. The beauty of this cutter is that it is only slightly off pace, which means the edge carries to the keeper. What joy on the young man's face. Lovely to watch",184/8,26421,41.6,c &dagger;Liton Das b Mustafizur Rahman 4 (10m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Ravichandran Ashwin
"and he has a six-for. Mustafizur has sent the crowd into a frenzy. He has 11 wickets in two matches. Full and straight to end the spell, Jadeja plays across its line, hits it into his pad, and the ricochets rattles the stumps. What a spell from Mustafizur",196/9,234675,43.6, b Mustafizur Rahman 19 (42m 26b 1x4 0x6) SR: 73.07,Ravindra Jadeja
"bouncer, and India are bowled out in 45 overs. What joy in the stands. Hossain bowls this at his head, Kumar looks to get his head out of the way and then pull it. Manages only to glove it through",200/10,326016,44.6,c &dagger;Liton Das b Rubel Hossain 3 (13m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.00,Bhuvneshwar Kumar
