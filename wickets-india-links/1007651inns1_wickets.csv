"as far as catches go, it can't get simpler than that. It was a delicious half-volley outside off, Masakadza's eyes lit up and he threw his bat at that, but didn't transfer any weight whatsoever forward, as the thick edge flew to Bumrah who took a regulation catch at third man. He perhaps played for some inswing when there was none. Sran looks up to the skies to thank the gods. First one in the bag for him today",19/1,55608,4.3,c Bumrah b Sran 9 (20m 17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 52.94,Hamilton Masakadza
"indecision in footwork has consumed him. Moor hopped back when he could have well prodded forward, and ends up getting into a tangle as the ball nips back in to hit him in front of middle. He pushed outside the line of the delivery too. Sran's morning just got better",21/2,333000,6.2,lbw b Sran 1 (7m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.11,Peter Moor
"the bluff, or was it unintended? Two deliveries that moved away, this one comes back in from the off stump. Chibhabha is caught on the crease and by surprise as the ball thuds into his pad as he looks to awkwardly work it across the line. The umpire had no doubt whatsoever. That would have crashed into the stumps.",39/3,55354,9.6,lbw b Kulkarni 21 (46m 26b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.76,Chamu Chibhabha
"he tries to break the shackles but he's holed out to long-on! It was pitched up around off, Raza went across the line and tried to clear the fielder in the deep but found him pretty comfortably. Kedar Jadhav it was",106/4,299572,25.2,c Jadhav b Chahal 16 (57m 41b 1x4 0x6) SR: 39.02,Sikandar Raza
"oh, he's gone first ball, Chahal has him lbw! It looked very close and umpire Langton Rusere gave it out confidently. Looks like the flighted ball pitched on leg and turned just enough to come back towards the stumps as Chigumbura came forward to defend but missed. Replays show it pitched on leg and would have hit middle and leg. So all good with the decision",106/5,55343,25.3,lbw b Chahal 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Elton Chigumbura
"oh my, Sibanda has given it away. There go Zimbabwe's hopes! It was a length delivery well outside off and Sibanda went ahead with a big slog-sweep, but the ball turned a fair bit and took a leading edge that went really high. Enough time for Jadhav to come forward and to his left for an easy catch",107/6,55787,27.4,c Jadhav b Chahal 53 (84m 69b 6x4 1x6) SR: 76.81,Vusi Sibanda
"inside edge as the ball nips in sharply and the finger goes up! Short delivery that pitched well outside off and jagged in sharply off the pitch to get a faint inside edge and Dhoni did the rest by going to his left. Mutumbami shakes his head, but replays show there was something the ball touched on its way. Looks like bat unless more replays suggest otherwise",112/7,235516,30.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Bumrah 2 (17m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28,Richmond Mutumbami
"that one pitched outside off, this one on off and then knocks it over! Nice seam position of the ball as it was back of length and held its line, making Chatara wanting to flick it to leg but the movement beat him and struck top of off",115/8,425639,31.4, b Kulkarni 2 (5m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Tendai Chatara
"more flight and using the angle to aim for the stumps, loud appeal and Gould gives it out after a couple of seconds! It was like a flighted slider as Muzarabani went forward to defend and was struck right in front",126/10,232444,34.3,lbw b Patel 5 (12m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Taurai Muzarabani
