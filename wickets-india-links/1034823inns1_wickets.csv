"he's reverse swept straight to the only man anywhere in the vicinity. The shot is perhaps on because it is a fuller delivery and there is plenty of room and Billings is excellent with this shot. This time though he can't get enough power into the shot. And Bumrah, on the edge of the circle at short third man, leaps up and takes it reverse-cup over his head. Jadeja, without looking especially threatening, strikes",98/1,297628,17.2,c Bumrah b Jadeja 35 (76m 58b 5x4 0x6) SR: 60.34,Sam Billings
"does him again! The trajectory. It's all about the trajectory. This is flat, so Roy goes back, making room to cut. But the length is full. And as such the moment he chooses the shot he chooses, he is a sitting duck. The ball pitches, hurries off the pitch and crashes into middle and leg. Good innings from Roy, but a familiar end. Goes off muttering to himself. Once again he gets set and gets out",110/2,298438,19.4, b Jadeja 65 (84m 56b 10x4 1x6) SR: 116.07,Jason Roy
"that's awful. Much like Billings, Morgan has picked the only man in the pincode. This is a silly old ball, way down leg and he looks for some easy runs by flicking it away off his hips. Doesn't mind Bumrah who is stationed there inside the circle, like he was for Billings, and he completes a simple catch. <b>That's drinks</B>",194/3,24598,33.4,c Bumrah b Pandya 43 (56m 44b 2x4 3x6) SR: 97.72,Eoin Morgan
"no timing at all in his on-the-up drive. It's a fuller, wider delivery. Innocuous really. Buttler goes through with his shot taking on a well-populated offside field and picks out the man at cover",212/4,308967,37.6,c Rahul b Pandya 11 (19m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 73.33,Jos Buttler
"he's cut it straight to backward point, and Jadeja diving forward collects it gleefully. Pandya's showing off his tricks at the Eden. This is a little short, a little wide, but oddly Bairstow does't carve it as powerfully as he perhaps should have. Is he surprised by the ball holding in the pitch a bit. Is this a little change of pace? Nope. Replays show it's got nothing mysterious about it. But whatever it is, England lose a set batsman",237/5,297433,41.3,c Jadeja b Pandya 56 (99m 64b 5x4 1x6) SR: 87.50,Jonny Bairstow
"top-edge, onto helmet and taken at backward point. Moeen's bounced out. He looks extremely suspect against this line of attack. The umpires ask the batsman to wait to check the no-ball, but this time Bumrah's fine. He cramps the batsman for room, makes sure the ball was rising up over his shoulder, up at his nose. And in such cases, the hook, with no room to work with, is a poor shot. Although usually it sails over the keeper's head...",246/6,8917,42.6,c Jadeja b Bumrah 2 (7m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Moeen Ali
"he's run out at the non-strikers' end. Stokes wants to pinch a single with the ball wandering down leg. Woakes has no chance of making his ground, considering Dhoni had tossed the ball to Bhuvi, to the righ tend and Woakes sacrifices his wicket",319/7,247235,49.5,run out (Kumar/&dagger;Dhoni) 34 (35m 19b 4x4 1x6) SR: 178.94,Chris Woakes
"shimmies down the pitch and hammers a full toss to long-off. Plunkett goes for a second run, what does he have to lose, it's the last ball and the single is already in the book. This is good scampering from England. He dives in desperation but the throw from long-off beats him",321/8,19264,49.6,run out (sub [MK Pandey]/&dagger;Dhoni) 1 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Liam Plunkett
