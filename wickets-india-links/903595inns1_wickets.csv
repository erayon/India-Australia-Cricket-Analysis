cleaned im up. What a strike. What an important strike that is. Too full and Rohit is slightly late on the flick. He is beaten for pace as the ball clips his pads and takes the off stump out. Huge wicket for SA.,3/1,34102,1.4, b Rabada 3 (6m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.00,Rohit Sharma
"soft dismissal. Loss in concentration there. Slower offcutter outside off, Dhawan just chips the ball to short cover. JP Duminy is surprised as he takes it. But that was a deceitful change in pace from Morkel. After all that pace, he goes slower and full which results in Dhawan going through the stroke much earlier",59/2,28235,12.3,c Duminy b Morkel 23 (57m 34b 4x4 0x6) SR: 67.64,Shikhar Dhawan
"<b>dropped</b> at mid-off but there's a <b>run out</b>, what a horrible mix up, the two batsmen end up at non-striker's end! Kohli is out and he's absolutely livid! Rahane drove the ball down uppishly and in the air, Behardien leapt in the air and got both hands but it was a tough chance and it went down. The batsmen watch that and take one, then Kohli sprints back for the second while Rahane holds his hand up to say no but Kohli wants the run. Both are at the same end and the bails are taken off by the keeper. Kohli did make it on time and he was running to the danger end so looks like there was a run there",82/3,253802,17.6,run out (Behardien/Steyn/&dagger;de Kock) 12 (24m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Virat Kohli
"he's <b>bowled him round the legs</b>! Tahir has taken off and Rahane can't believe it, he's still on the crease and is asking the umpires now. The umpires refer it to the third umpire. Rahane was sweeping the ball which pitched outside leg, but he misses and the ball turned just enough to clip the leg stump",102/4,277916,22.4, b Imran Tahir 51 (94m 63b 6x4 0x6) SR: 80.95,Ajinkya Rahane
"he's caught down the leg side, it was a short ball after all! Raina kept shuffling towards the off side, Morkel kept bowling them short and this time Raina was strangled down the leg side and even got a faint edge and QDK takes a good diving catch. The umpires check for a no ball and it's fine, Raina walks back",104/5,33335,23.4,c &dagger;de Kock b Morkel 0 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Suresh Raina
"loud appeal for lbw and Steyn pumps his fists as the finger goes up! Slightly back of length ball on leg stump, it was headed towards the leg stump as Axar tried to clip it to leg but was trapped on the back foot. Looks like it pitched right on the leg stump line, not outside, and Aleem Dar was the umpire not Kulkarni if you were wondering. Axar was a bit on his toes and the ball hit him just above the knee roll",124/6,554691,29.3,lbw b Steyn 13 (20m 27b 0x4 1x6) SR: 48.14,Axar Patel
"and he has got him this time. Just a little slower through the air and Kumar looks to drive through long-off anticipating some legspin but this one doesn't spin. There is however, a huge gap between bat and pad and the delivery sneaks through and clips leg stump.",165/7,326016,39.3, b Imran Tahir 14 (42m 32b 1x4 0x6) SR: 43.75,Bhuvneshwar Kumar
"short and extremely sweet from Harbhajan. Good cameo that, but Dhoni will have to farm the strike now. Full outside off, harbhajan swipes at that and gets a thick outside edge which flies to de Kock who clings onto a sharp chance to his right.",221/8,29264,46.3,c &dagger;de Kock b Steyn 22 (33m 22b 2x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Harbhajan Singh
"139 ks, and what a catch from de Kock. Only reflex. Yadav chooses a decent shot but doesn't execute well enough in a game of fine margins. Back of a length and Yadav looks to steer the ball to third man with the pace. But the ball goes too fine, de Kock dives to his right and takes a stunning catch. Excellently held.",225/9,376116,46.6,c &dagger;de Kock b Steyn 4 (3m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33,Umesh Yadav
