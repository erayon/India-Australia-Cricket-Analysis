"he's gone for the hook and he's been caught at long leg! Dhawan was on the front foot, out of the crease in fact, as he tried to hook a short ball that climbed sharply on him. He was cramped for room and could only top edge it towards Marsh, who came running forward and to his left to take the catch",36/1,28235,6.4,c Marsh b Hazlewood 9 (27m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40.90,Shikhar Dhawan
"Kohli's hit that hard off the front foot, he's hit that flat, and the ball is headed over the long-on boundary but Finch runs to his left and takes the catch at head height. Kohli falls close to his hundred after an outstanding partnership. He's set India up for a huge total, but can the remaining batsmen hit from the get-go? Kohli timed that really well, just did not hit it high enough",243/2,253802,44.3,c Finch b Faulkner 91 (148m 97b 9x4 1x6) SR: 93.81,Virat Kohli
"this is a superb catch from the debutant! Dhoni rocked back to the short ball and pulled hard, hitting the ball out of the middle. The ball was flying quickly to Boland's right and was nearly past him when he stuck out his right hand and grabbed it",286/3,28081,48.2,c Boland b Faulkner 18 (18m 13b 1x4 1x6) SR: 138.46,MS Dhoni
