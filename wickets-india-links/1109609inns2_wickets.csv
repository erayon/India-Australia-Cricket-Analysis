"<b>Munaweera fumbles a couple of times at fine leg, but holds on.</b> Bouncer at middle stump, gets under this hook as it continues to climb on him. Bent way out of shape and top edges it, straight into the path of Munaweera who manages to somehow get it behind him after getting a hand, and then swivels to catch it",17/1,277916,4.4,c Munaweera b Malinga 5 (m 17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 29.41,Ajinkya Rahane
"<b>stunning take at short fine leg!</b> Pushpakumara leaps to his right to hold on to Rohit's ramp. This was angled across off stump at a length. Was well wide. But Rohit saw fine leg in and looked to clear him. Wasn't quite close to the ball and was stretching out at it. Not the best execution of that shot, but what a catch. He looked to have got enough height on it",29/2,34102,7.3,c Pushpakumara b Fernando 16 (m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Rohit Sharma
"Oh, Pandey. What have you done? The stage was set for him to milk the runs, possibly a big score,  but what does he do? Attempts an ugly slog sweep that he has to fetch from outside off, ends up top-edging it to Tharanga who takes a dolly at midwicket. Some relief for Sri Lanka. A 99-run stand has been broken",128/3,290630,25.1,c Tharanga b Pushpakumara 36 (m 53b 2x4 0x6) SR: 67.92,Manish Pandey
"<b>caught behind.</b> Short and spinning away from off. Looks to nudge it past short third man, but only manages a tickle through to Dickwella who takes a neat catch",237/4,290716,46.1,c &dagger;Dickwella b de Silva 63 (m 73b 7x4 0x6) SR: 86.30,Kedar Jadhav
