what a tame dismissal. Looking to hit this length ball over mid-off but there's no power behind that whatsoever. Got it off the top part of the bat as it lobbed to Kohli. As easy as they come. Lewis has wasted an opportunity on a batting belter.,39/1,431901,8.2,c Kohli b Pandya 9 (m 20b 0x4 0x6) SR: 45.00,Evin Lewis
"picks out Dhawan at midwicket. This wasn't all that short, he'd premeditated the pull, went through with it off the frontfoot and hit it straight into the hands of him there. Start wasted. Not the kind of delivery that deserved a wicket but Umesh will take it.",76/2,443150,15.5,c Dhawan b Yadav 46 (m 50b 9x4 0x6) SR: 92.00,Kyle Hope
"and he's gone first ball! Unless his review overturns Leslie Reifer's on-field verdict. Full and straight right up, with a little bit of late inswing. He plays across the line, around his front pad. Ball is full enough to sneak under his bat. Impact around middle and leg, and he barely took a stride forward, so it's no surprise that ball-tracking says it's crashing into a good chunk of leg stump",76/3,391832,15.6,lbw b Yadav 0 (m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Roston Chase
"gone! Kedar Jadhav keeps getting wickets with utter filth, because sometimes utter filth is utterly difficult to combat. This is a shortish ball, not a long-hop, just short enough to provoke the batsman to rock back and look to slap it away into the covers. But it's on off stump, it doesn't give him that much room, and it sticks on the pitch a little. Result, a dolly of a return catch, slapped straight back at waist height",115/4,230549,30.3,c &amp; b Jadhav 16 (m 39b 0x4 0x6) SR: 41.02,Jason Mohammed
"muscles this to Dhawan, who takes an excellent catch running to his left at long-on. This was travelling but he anticipated it and moved quickly to make it look ridiculously easy. Holder overambitious on that occasion and has paid the price for it.",163/5,391485,39.5,c Dhawan b Mohammed Shami 36 (m 34b 4x4 1x6) SR: 105.88,Jason Holder
"this is outstanding from Rahane. Catch of the series. He took on the length ball to pull, skewed it high in the air towards deep midwicket. Rahane, at deep square, was coming in. He called for it, came in and realised the ball was swirling away, but kept his eyes on the ball and dived full-length to his left to pluck that just before it touched the ground. Terrific",168/6,581379,41.4,c Rahane b Mohammed Shami 51 (m 98b 5x4 0x6) SR: 52.04,Shai Hope
"another soft dismissal. Chipped straight to short midwicket. The delivery slanted back in from wide of the crease, he looked to go over mid-on perhaps and got a thick inside edge. Shami has looked in excellent rhythm all day",171/7,315594,43.3,c Kuldeep Yadav b Mohammed Shami 0 (m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Ashley Nurse
"backs away to try and ramp this over Dhoni's head but this didn't bounce as much as it should have, ends up feathering an edge to Dhoni",182/8,341593,46.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b Mohammed Shami 6 (m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Devendra Bishoo
"Pure pace. This is the short ball angling into the body, he looks to pull but the ball gets big on him and gloves it down leg to Dhoni. Handy knock",205/9,820351,49.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 31 (m 32b 0x4 2x6) SR: 96.87,Rovman Powell
