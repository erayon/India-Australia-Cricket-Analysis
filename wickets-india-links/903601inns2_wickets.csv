caught at third man and Abbott has got the big one! Rohit was going for a heave ho seeing it was a length ball. But I think this was off the toe end which carries quite nicely to Imran Tahir running in from the boundary. Excellent start for South Africa,22/1,34102,4.6,c Imran Tahir b Abbott 16 (21m 20b 3x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Rohit Sharma
"chases the wide one and edges it again! de Kock, take a bow. That is a catch that will be replayed forever. He might well be the best ODI keeper around right now. Rabada goes full, Kohli has to reach for it because he is lead-footed. It was a run-scoring opportunity because it is almost an overpitched delivery. But the extra pace seems to work against the batsman. Big nick, which means it hurtles between slip and the keeper. de Kock flings himself full length to his right and plucks it with one hand",44/2,253802,7.4,c &dagger;de Kock b Rabada 7 (11m 6b 0x4 1x6) SR: 116.66,Virat Kohli
"goes across the line with a flick as Rabada angles the fuller ball across the left-hander. Leading edge presents a chance but has the fielder hurt himself in the process of taking a great old catch? Hashim Amla it is. Everyone is checking on him. It looks like he is bleeding just above his left eye. His head thudded fliush into the ground after he completed the catch. Ouch, that looked bad. But still he was able to hold on.",156/3,28235,22.3,c Amla b Rabada 60 (100m 59b 8x4 0x6) SR: 101.69,Shikhar Dhawan
"moved too far across, worried about the short ball, but this is the deadly leg-stump yorker that sneaks past him and clatters his castle! Rabada showing he has smarts to go with his raw ability. Gets a big ol hug from his captain AB de Villiers. Pace is pace, even on flat wickets.",172/4,33335,24.5, b Rabada 12 (10m 13b 1x4 1x6) SR: 92.30,Suresh Raina
"pace works again. Sheer express and accurate pace. This is short on middle, Rahane has to go for the big hit. Launches it over midwicket, but there is a man in the deep and he collects the simplest of catches. Steyn pops a vein celebrating, as per. South Africa are nearing yet another away series win",185/5,277916,26.2,c Behardien b Steyn 87 (87m 58b 9x4 3x6) SR: 150.00,Ajinkya Rahane
all too simple for Steyn. He yells until he loses his voice after Axar slices a short ball straight at point.,195/6,554691,28.6,c Miller b Steyn 5 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 62.50,Axar Patel
"tapped away to cover, that's a third for Steyn. It was a short of a length delivery, but Bhajji was into the push a bit too quickly. Ball held up in the pitch and became his downfall.",201/7,29264,30.2,c sub (CH Morris) b Steyn 0 (6m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Harbhajan Singh
"drops it a touch short, Bhuvneshwar looks to swipe it from way outside off, hits near the bottom of the bat and holes out to Miller, India sinking fast but the crowd singing ""Sachin, Sachin"" as the giantscreen shows Tendulkar in the stands",210/8,326016,32.6,c Miller b Imran Tahir 1 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 12.50,Bhuvneshwar Kumar
"got 'im! the Tahir googly is too good for Dhoni, he was charging down the pitch, but doesn't expect the ball to spin in, it slips past the inside edge and on to the stumps, this game is heading for a quick close now",219/9,28081,34.2, b Imran Tahir 27 (50m 29b 3x4 0x6) SR: 93.10,MS Dhoni
"great reply from the standout bowler of the series Kagiso Rabada, a yorker that is much too good for the tailender, plumb in front, and South Africa complete their first bilateral series victory in India with something close to the perfect performance. The margin of victory is an astonishing 214 runs!",224/10,31107,35.6,lbw b Rabada 4 (12m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 57.14,Amit Mishra
