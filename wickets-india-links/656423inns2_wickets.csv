"gone! That's the first time de Kock hasn't scored a century against India. It's a bit fuller but nowhere near full enough to drive. Goes hard at it and scoops a low catch to Kohli, tumbling forward from mid-off",12/1,379143,3.3,c Kohli b Mohammed Shami 7 (15m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 46.66,Quinton de Kock
"gone! The short ball's done the trick. Again it was outside off, not the easiest line to pull from. Amla top-edged it and Shami took it brilliantly at long leg, over his head with both hands, moving backwards but ensuring he stopped well short of the rope",40/2,43906,10.2,c Mohammed Shami b MM Sharma 22 (50m 28b 2x4 0x6) SR: 78.57,Hashim Amla
"driven to sweeper cover and India are convinced there's a run-out. Good throw in from Mohit, right next to the stumps, and Dhoni did the rest even as AB stretched to complete the second. They go up to the third umpire, and he's a good couple of inches short when the bails light up. Massive moment for India",108/3,44936,22.5,run out (MM Sharma/&dagger;Dhoni) 30 (47m 38b 3x4 0x6) SR: 78.94,AB de Villiers
"got him! Came down the track and looked to flat-bat it down the ground. Wasn't the right ball for it, it was shorter than ideal, and it hit high on his bat and popped straight into mid-off's hands",133/4,44828,28.1,c Dhawan b MM Sharma 55 (98m 71b 5x4 0x6) SR: 77.46,Faf du Plessis
"and that is that for JP. Goes for the reverse sweep, and it goes with the angle again, hits his glove, and pops up to present the slip fielder an absolute dolly",147/5,44932,31.3,c Raina b Ashwin 6 (16m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Jean-Paul Duminy
"another run-out! Sweeps, finds Umesh at deep square leg, and they try to take on his arm again. Excellent throw, and Dhoni doesn't have too much work to do - in fact, he's flicked it into the stumps. They go to the third umpire, and the bails light up with the sliding Miller's bat in the air.",153/6,321777,33.4,run out (Yadav/&dagger;Dhoni) 22 (45m 23b 2x4 0x6) SR: 95.65,David Miller
"loud, sustained lbw appeal, given. Goes on the back foot and it turns in sharply and hits him on the back pad. Not sure if it hit in line. He's reviewed. No inside-edge on it, Snicko confirms. Hit the back pad on the knee roll, just in line with off stump, and then hits the top of middle stump according to Hawkeye. Two umpire's calls, and that means he's a goner",153/7,46945,33.6,lbw b Ashwin 0 (4m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Vernon Philander
"short on off stump, tried to make room to cut, can only pop it straight into the hands of cover point",158/8,47492,36.2,c Dhawan b Mohammed Shami 1 (8m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28,Dale Steyn
"a bit of air now, angling in towards middle and leg, and he clears his front leg to slog-sweep, misses it completely and it straightens to clatter into the stumps",161/9,46538,37.2, b Ashwin 2 (3m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Morne Morkel
"and that is that. Round-arm, angled in, goes with the arm and hits him on the front pad, halfway forward to defend, and it's lbw even before he appealed",177/10,40618,40.2,lbw b Jadeja 8 (11m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Imran Tahir
