"well bowled. A yorker, but forget it. India have got lucky here. Lucky in that they have been provided a run-out opportunity out of nowhere. Tamim digs it out to leg, there is no single available, but Sarkar sets off. Rightly sent back, but not in time. Raina swoops in, gets an underarm flick in, and catches him short with a direct hit. Lucky that they get the opportunity, skilful in cashing it in",102/1,436677,13.4,run out (Raina) 54 (56m 40b 8x4 1x6) SR: 135.00,Soumya Sarkar
"what a concentration break. He was playing so well before the rain break. Then came an over with just one run, and he has thrown it away now. You expect better from one of your best batsmen. He has left the crease and lofted this straight down the throat of long-off. This is not a mis-hit. He has hit this in the direction of the fielder, almost as if he thought the mid-off was up in the circle. To Ashwin's credit, he did cramp Tamim up, but he has worked harder for wickets",123/2,56194,17.3,c RG Sharma b Ashwin 60 (74m 62b 7x4 1x6) SR: 96.77,Tamim Iqbal
"Ashwin strikes again. He has bowled this one superbly. Gets the offbreak to dip, Das thinks he is to pitch of the ball but isn't. He goes ahead with the drive, but Ashwin has created enough separation to turn this back in and hit his pad. Right in front of off he is hit. The ball would have hit middle",129/3,536936,19.4,lbw b Ashwin 8 (23m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 61.53,Liton Das
"Rahim down the wicket, looks for a straight six, but has holed out. Ashwin is on a roll. Bangladesh are imploding. The idea is right, in that he is looking to go straight, but the ball has dipped ever so slightly to pitch out of the zone of a clean swing. The mis-hit settles with Rohit Sharma at straight long-on",146/4,56029,23.3,c RG Sharma b Ashwin 14 (18m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 73.68,Mushfiqur Rahim
"timber. Jadeja strikes. For all his criticism Jadeja has done well today. Sabbir has been looking to slog sweep him. The first one beat him and missed off by six inches. The next one, taken from wide outside off, was connected well and went for four. This, though, was straighter than the first one, and beat Sabbir to hit the off stump. He is one of the tougher bowlers to slog-sweep",229/5,373538,37.5, b Jadeja 41 (56m 44b 5x4 1x6) SR: 93.18,Sabbir Rahman
"This is short and wide. Shakib can hit it anywhere b ut he has hit this straight to backward point. Can you believe it? This is not a slower delivery but has stuck in the pitch, which has defeated his shot and made him hit it straight to the fielder",267/6,56143,43.4,c Jadeja b Yadav 52 (93m 68b 3x4 0x6) SR: 76.47,Shakib Al Hasan
"lovely catch by Jadeja. A full toss, on off, Hossain gets hit high on the bat - nowhere near waist high, though - and the outside edge seems to have lobbed over point. Jadeja runs back, almost over-runs it, but then gets both the hands up, reverse cups, to catch it",282/7,300618,45.6,c Jadeja b Yadav 34 (35m 27b 3x4 1x6) SR: 125.92,Nasir Hossain
"India keep chipping away. Kumar tucks him up with a short-of-a-length delivery with no room. Rubel is mostly a front-foot player, and he is handcuffed here with the ball rising chest high. All he manages is a lob to mid-off",286/8,300619,46.5,c MM Sharma b Kumar 4 (3m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Rubel Hossain
"this wicket was a-comin'. Taskin has been frustrated by the short balls. This time he walks down to one, is in no position, and the edge settles with cover",298/9,538506,48.5,c Kohli b Kumar 2 (10m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Taskin Ahmed
"so Sharma does what Yadav has been doing. Digs one in short, the ball gets head high, Mortaza is not in control of it, and offers R Sharma  catch at mid-on",307/10,56007,49.4,c RG Sharma b MM Sharma 21 (33m 18b 3x4 0x6) SR: 116.66,Mashrafe Mortaza
