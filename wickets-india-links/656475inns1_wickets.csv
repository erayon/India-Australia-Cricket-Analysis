"back of a length outside of off and another one bites the dust for Zimbabwe as now both openers are back in the shed after Chamu played half-heartedly at this delivery from Shami, providing a thick edge to Dhawan at slip, who took it just to the right of his position",13/2,55354,4.3,c Dhawan b Mohammed Shami 7 (20m 16b 1x4 0x6) SR: 43.75,Chamu Chibhabha
"length delivery outside of off which just nibbles away as Mire feathers the slightest of edges to Dhoni. MS knew right away, but Mohit had to be coerced at the last minute, but Mire ends up pulling a Gilchrist and walking before the final decision was taken",33/3,290462,10.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b MM Sharma 9 (31m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40.90,Solomon Mire
"Ashwin able to reach low to take this attempted bludgeon past him from Williams. The batsman is not sure if this has carried though, with the umpires making sure by pulling up the replay. They do confirm the ball did carry enough, as India pick up a big wicket here as Williams has to go soon after reaching his fifty",126/4,55870,28.3,c &amp; b Ashwin 50 (66m 57b 3x4 3x6) SR: 87.71,Sean Williams
"and the Taylor special has to come to a close as he looked to force away this back of a length over the mid-on region, but ends up losing a glove off the handle as he went for the loft, with this one spooning comfortably to the fielder. Congratulations from the Indian players as he makes his way off the ground. One of the all-time great performances by a batsman playing his last international innings. Has he done enough to give Zimbabwe a threatening total in Auckland though?",235/5,55814,41.5,c Dhawan b MM Sharma 138 (155m 110b 15x4 5x6) SR: 125.45,Brendan Taylor
"excellent slower delivery from Mohit that makes Ervine looks slightly amateur as he dances down before getting a top-edge to this disguised ball from the bowler, with the ball flying high over to Mohit, who barely had to move from his position when it went up initially. Ends a solid contribution from the left-hander, but Zimbabwe will need plenty more as we get into the latter stages",241/6,55412,43.1,c &amp; b MM Sharma 27 (67m 41b 1x4 1x6) SR: 65.85,Craig Ervine
goes round the wicket and delivers the y-word which seemed to have been missing all this time. This one finds its mark right at the base of middle. Ends a lovely little cameo from Raza as Zimbabwe look to pile on the runs,276/7,299572,45.6, b Mohammed Shami 28 (19m 15b 1x4 3x6) SR: 186.66,Sikandar Raza
"Shami delivers again towards the death for India as Tinashe tries in vain to bludgeon this fuller one high over the cow corner boundary, but ends up holing to deep midwicket",285/8,55705,47.3,c Yadav b Mohammed Shami 6 (7m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Tinashe Panyangara
"Yadav able to remove the dangerous Regis as he delivers a 142 kph bouncer which the batsman fails to latch onto as he looked to go over fine leg, but ends up holding out to Rohit in the deep at backward square. India just one away now from making it a perfect 60 out of 60 wickets for the tournament",286/9,293831,48.1,c RG Sharma b Yadav 10 (26m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 76.92,Regis Chakabva
