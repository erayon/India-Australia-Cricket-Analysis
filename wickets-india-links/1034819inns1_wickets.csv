"has Bumrah created the magic India need for a wicket? Direct hit from the depp, and yes he has created the magic. Roy has shuffled across to work this towards fine leg with soft hands. Bumrah swoops in from fine leg, surprises Hales with a throw at the non-striker's end, and Hales doesn't even dive. This is slightly dopey from Hales. First he is not expecting the throw at his end, and then he doesn't put in a dive. We do have a bit of a situation here, though. The umpire and Kohli have blocked the cameras from either end, and the third umpire can't see the bails. He makes the decision relying on the illuminating of the LED stumps. Hales is on the line when the stump flashes up",39/1,249866,6.2,run out (Bumrah) 9 (30m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Alex Hales
"and Jadeja provides the breakthrough. The most economical bowler on the day produces an impatient shot, and gets the stumping. That drop from Yadav hasn't cost them much. Roy leaves the crease too early, Jadeja fires one in. Roy plays a defensive shot because he is not to the pitch of the ball, but he plays for the turn. The ball goes straight on past the inside edge, and Dhoni is not one to miss these stumpings",108/2,298438,18.3,st &dagger;Dhoni b Jadeja 73 (78m 61b 12x4 0x6) SR: 119.67,Jason Roy
"<strong>Nandan has not given it, and India have reviewed it</strong>. Dhoni generally doesn't appeal frivolously and this time he looks dead sure. Short of a length, angling away, and Morgan looks to open his face. He gets an edge through to Dhoni, and Nandadn has to overturn his call for a second time today. Just slight seam after pitching middle and leg, and kisses the edge",157/3,24598,26.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b Pandya 28 (36m 26b 2x4 1x6) SR: 107.69,Eoin Morgan
"and Pandya sticks to his guns well enough. He has been bowling with mid-on and mid-off up, and has not given them even one drive ball. Buttler looks to manufacture one to a ball just short of a length, and doesn;t get enough of bat to it. Caught overhead at mid-off by Dhawan. India strike again with England looking to run away from them",220/4,308967,37.5,c Dhawan b Pandya 31 (40m 36b 1x4 2x6) SR: 86.11,Jos Buttler
"misjudged to begin with but Pandya adjusts well to take the catch at long-on. Another wily slower ball from Bumrah, Root clears the front leg to slog this length ball straight to long-on. Pandya has started to run in, then realises it is sailing over, and then backtracks to take it overhead",244/5,303669,41.4,c Pandya b Bumrah 78 (141m 95b 4x4 1x6) SR: 82.10,Joe Root
Bumrah gets a wicket. Will this slow England down? Bouncer from over the wicket. A good one. At his left shoulder. Stokes mis-hits the pull and finds deep midwicket. That innings has turned the momentum for England,317/6,311158,47.1,c Yadav b Bumrah 62 (42m 40b 2x4 5x6) SR: 155.00,Ben Stokes
Moeen tries to be too cute and he is bowled. He looks for a reverse paddle sweep to a leg-side yorker and plays it on to his middle and off. Played off the back of the bat,336/7,8917,48.4, b Yadav 28 (34m 17b 3x4 1x6) SR: 164.70,Moeen Ali
