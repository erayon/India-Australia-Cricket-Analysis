"you absolute beauty! This is why Pakistan wanted Amir, even a version that only just recovered from a back spasm. The inswing. This scary, sensational, freakish ability to move the ball even on the flattest conditions at searing pace. Rohit is about as ready for this ball as the we are for Bruce Willis to actually go to outer space and drill a hole into an asteroid. #Armageddon. Stuck in the crease, plays around his front pad. Pinned on the knee roll.,Gone",0/1,34102,0.3,lbw b Mohammad Amir 0 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Rohit Sharma
"got him next ball. Amir, you legend! He takes flight. He punches the air like it spoke ill of his family. A fit, even a half fit bowler like him is worth tons for a team. This is back of a length, on off stump, and Kohli, looking to move across and flick into the on side gets a leading edge straight to point. Amir makes him play early. Amir sends him back. Amir puts a smile on Pakistan's face. Amir is making The Oval chant his name",6/2,253802,2.4,c Shadab Khan b Mohammad Amir 5 (11m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 55.55,Virat Kohli
"nicked off, It's Amir again! This time with extra bounce! Is there anything he can't do?! The perfect ball. It's a cross-seamer - brilliant thinking - in that off stump corridor. Dhawan loads up the glide to third man, as Amir might have predicted as he held the ball across the seam, willing it to bounce more. And it does. Grazes the outside edge through to Sarfraz who leaps for joy. This is the power of a fast bowler on a mission. They end games in a matter of minutes.",33/3,28235,8.6,c &dagger;Sarfraz Ahmed b Mohammad Amir 21 (42m 22b 4x4 0x6) SR: 95.45,Shikhar Dhawan
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b>, Shadab thinks it is pad first, and it's the sharp-turning leggie as well. Shadab is absolutely certain. He has convinced his captain to <b>review</b>. Replays show that it is pad first. Hits low as well. But Yuvi has a decent stride in. On-field call is not out. But it has to be changed! Ball-tracker shows it will hit middle of middle and the 18-year old has a strike all his own. Made his captain take DRS and then celebrates a vital wicket.",54/4,36084,12.6,lbw b Shadab Khan 22 (49m 31b 4x4 0x6) SR: 70.96,Yuvraj Singh
"taken by the deep square leg fielder. Dhoni's gone! The leg trap, the short ball trap was set and it's been sprung! There's a quick check for the no-ball. And Hasan's fine. He is better than fine after bowling this short ball, rising up towards Dhoni's ribs, cramping him on middle and leg. The batsman swings hard, and he's a good puller, Dhoni. This time though, he top edges to Imad, running in and diving foward. Hasan pulls out his trademark celebration, the pretend smoke bomb onto the pitch and as the smoke clears he is there, arms spread wide, looking like a proper hero.",54/5,28081,13.3,c Imad Wasim b Hasan Ali 4 (23m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,MS Dhoni
"top edge and the captain takes it himself at cover! ""Yaaaah,"" he yells feeling a Champions Trophy coming his way. He sees Jadhav shaping to pull a short ball, he loves that it goes straight up, he sends nearly six of his team-mates rushing for the same catch back and takes it himself",72/6,290716,16.6,c &dagger;Sarfraz Ahmed b Shadab Khan 9 (18m 13b 2x4 0x6) SR: 69.23,Kedar Jadhav
"mix up! Pandya's run out! He is furious and well he might be... Jadeja played into the covers, not sure if he called but Pandya was well down, his partner had begun to move down the pitch before turning back and the fielder had time to pick his end, throwing to Hasan to complete a simple run-out. Terrible from Jadeja, ball-watching and costing India their last hope",152/7,625371,26.3,run out (Mohammad Hafeez/Hasan Ali) 76 (46m 43b 4x4 6x6) SR: 176.74,Hardik Pandya
"slashed to slip, Pakistan are two away! Jadeja falls on his sword, having impaled Pandya in the previous over, first wicket for Junaid thanks to a sharp catch at wide-ish slip",156/8,234675,27.3,c Babar Azam b Junaid Khan 15 (41m 26b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.69,Ravindra Jadeja
"Hasan gets another, nicked to the keeper! Sarfraz comes charging up in celebration as the umpire sends Ashwin on his way... Shortish outside off, draws a little fiddle from the batsman and the men in green explode again",156/9,26421,28.1,c &dagger;Sarfraz Ahmed b Hasan Ali 1 (11m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Ravichandran Ashwin
"dug in, flapped into the air, Sarfraz tears forward and leaps to claim the catch that <b>wins Pakistan the Champions Trophy!</b> Hasan, the tournament's leading wicket-taker, crowns victory with his third and Pakistan haven blown India away by 180 runs!",158/10,625383,30.3,c &dagger;Sarfraz Ahmed b Hasan Ali 1 (10m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.11,Jasprit Bumrah
