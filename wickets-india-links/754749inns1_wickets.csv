"edged and taken! Starc continues where he left off against England. It's a teaser outside off and the fuller length drew Dhwan into that favourite cover drive of his. Except he doesn't account for the outswing again. Thick edge flies towards Finch at slip, who takes it over his head",3/1,28235,0.5,c Finch b Starc 2 (3m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Shikhar Dhawan
"nicked and taken. There's that bounce that he seems to get and it bests Rahane's intention to cut. Top strike for a first one, and it was brought about by the pressure created and sustained at both ends. There wasn't enough room for the shot, but Rahane opted for it and pays the price",33/2,277916,7.2,c &dagger;Haddin b Sandhu 12 (29m 22b 2x4 0x6) SR: 54.54,Ajinkya Rahane
"so easily done! Kohli has perished to his own attacking intent. It was just a shade short, barely had room to free the hands. Short-armed pull came out and ends up as a top edge which is taken by the captain jogging in from mid-on.",59/3,253802,12.5,c Bailey b Faulkner 9 (24m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 56.25,Virat Kohli
he's thrown it away! It was a fuller delivery outside off and Raina got on the front foot and hacked it straight at mid-on. And you know what happens when Australia get an opening...,185/4,33335,34.6,c Maxwell b Starc 51 (105m 63b 6x4 0x6) SR: 80.95,Suresh Raina
his penultimate over of the match and he secures a huge strike for Australia. The offcutter has very little room but Dhoni wants to slice it. Gets a thick inside edge and it crashes into the stumps,237/5,28081,44.2, b Starc 19 (42m 31b 2x4 0x6) SR: 61.29,MS Dhoni
"there goes another domino! Spearing yorker strikes the back leg with Akshar playing all around it. Would that have missed leg? Beaten for pace, beaten for movement and India are slipping",237/6,554691,44.4,lbw b Starc 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Axar Patel
"caught on the edge of the circle, that is Starc's fifth and it comes off his worst ball of the day - a full toss. Rohit was looking for quick runs, but his cow-corner club comes low off the inside half of the bat and picks out midwicket",262/7,34102,48.4,c Maxwell b Starc 138 (228m 139b 9x4 4x6) SR: 99.28,Rohit Sharma
"cleaned him up! that's six! Changed the angle of delivery and came around the wicket to Bhuvi, the new batsman. It was full, it was speared in on middle. The batsman stayed beside the ball to open up the off side, but fails to connect with his shovel drive. Starc smile might as well translate as 'you miss, I hit'",262/8,326016,48.5, b Starc 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Bhuvneshwar Kumar
