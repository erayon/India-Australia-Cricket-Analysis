"holes out to sweeper cover. Pandya gets Kohli wickets. This is good length, outside off stump. Hope was visibly antsy, trying to open up and get quick runs. Makes him run down the pitch, that pressure, and slash away from the body. It's a leading edge that goes high into the off side and is taken easily",57/1,443150,17.2,c Jadhav b Pandya 35 (m 63b 4x4 0x6) SR: 55.55,Kyle Hope
"beautifully bowled. Down the track and the drift does Lewis in. He wants to drive this straighter, over mid-on, but it drifts into him, forces him to hit it squarer, and midwicket takes a good catch diving forward. The ball got too close to Lewis to let him free his arms fully",80/2,431901,21.5,c Kohli b Kuldeep Yadav 35 (m 60b 2x4 2x6) SR: 58.33,Evin Lewis
"whoa, that's a replay of his third-ODI dismissal! Googly, tossed up beautifully outside leg. Chase gets his feet out of the way to try and whip into the leg side, misses completely since he was playing for the stock ball, and the ball turns past his outside edge and clips the top of middle stump. Ball then ricochets and hits Dhoni's helmet grille",121/3,391832,31.2, b Kuldeep Yadav 24 (m 34b 2x4 0x6) SR: 70.58,Roston Chase
"cross-seam ball, back of a length outside off. Hope looks to open his bat face and steer it down to third man, but the ball straightens just a touch, with just a hint of extra bounce, and Dhoni falls to his right to pouch the nick",136/4,581379,34.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b Pandya 25 (m 39b 1x4 0x6) SR: 64.10,Shai Hope
"<b>caught down the leg side</b> and it's given. A back of a length ball, angled down leg side. Not a particularly fast ball either. Just an unlucky dismissal as he tries to tickle this fine",154/5,391485,38.1,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 11 (m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 110.00,Jason Holder
"<b>good catch.</b> Only Jadeja can make running backwards look so simple. This is back of a length and climbing in he corridor. He swipes across the line to try and pick the midwicket boundary but it's a leading edge that lobs up and swerves awkwardly as cover, backward point and sweeper cover all show interest. Jadeja's call is the loudest and they let him be. Adjusts his steps to perfection, shimmies slightly to his left after running back and holds on",161/6,820351,40.5,c Jadeja b Yadav 2 (m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22,Rovman Powell
"a straightforward one at backward point this time. Short and wide, and honestly, an average delivery. In the slot for the cut, but the mind doesn't always back you up at this level. Tentative in his approach and he hits it straight to Jadeja",162/7,230549,41.2,c Jadeja b Pandya 20 (m 33b 1x4 0x6) SR: 60.60,Jason Mohammed
"<b>top edge, helmet grille, diving fast bowler</b> and Nurse is done. Length ball hurries him as he stays put in the crease and looks to whip across the line. Hits the back of the bat, smashes the grille and lobs up to Umesh's right. He dives across the pitch and gets his third",179/8,315594,47.2,c &amp; b Yadav 4 (m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Ashley Nurse
"<b>too easy for Jadeja.</b> Good length at off stump, opens the face and hits it straight to point. He would've struggled on the best of days, but today he hesitated before the run as well. Jadeja knows this. Gathers the ball, balances himself, hops two steps and takes down the middle stump at the non-strikers end",184/9,341593,48.4,run out (Jadeja) 15 (m 30b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Devendra Bishoo
