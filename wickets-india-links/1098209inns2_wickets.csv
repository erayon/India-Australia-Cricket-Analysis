"gone, soft dismissal. That's full on leg stump, and Dhawan looks to flick but fails to keep it down and lobs up a simple catch to wide mid-on",10/1,28235,2.1,c Holder b Joseph 5 (m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 71.42,Shikhar Dhawan
"for the second match in a row, Holder has dismissed Kohli after troubling him with the short ball. Good bouncer, just outside off, similar to the one that he missed a few balls ago. This time he gets a top-edge that goes straight up, three storeys up, and Shai Hope takes a few steps forward and wraps his gloves around it",25/2,253802,5.6,c &dagger;SD Hope b Holder 3 (m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Virat Kohli
"another good, short ball. Another wicket. The shoulder-high bouncer outside off, and Karthik is late on it. The ball hits high on the bat, the outside half near the sticker, and loops up to the right of the keeper",47/3,30045,12.4,c &dagger;SD Hope b Joseph 2 (m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10.52,Dinesh Karthik
"Rahane has gone for a sweep, missed it entirely and it looks like he's been given out caught behind. Yes. He has reviewed straight away. There's a minuscule spike on Snicko as the ball passes the bottom of the bat. Earlier inspection shows the ball had hit his hip before the keeper took it...<b>and he's given out because of the spike.</b> This was a regulation legspinner, going away from off stump. Rahane stretched out for the sweep and evidence suggests the ball has kissed the toe end of the bat before hitting his hip",101/4,277916,30.5,c &dagger;SD Hope b Bishoo 60 (m 91b 7x4 0x6) SR: 65.93,Ajinkya Rahane
"gone, bat-pad! That was a slightly lazy defensive shot from Jadhav, barely a stride forward to a well-flighted ball outside off. A bit of dip, some extra bounce, and the inside-edge hits pad and lobs up into the short-leg region. The keeper moves quickly to his left, dives, and grabs it with one glove",116/5,290716,35.4,c &dagger;SD Hope b Nurse 10 (m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 71.42,Kedar Jadhav
bowled him! That is terrific. Pandya premeditated - I think fine leg was inside the circle - and shuffled across his stumps. Holder replied with a yorker that took out leg stump,159/6,625371,45.1, b Holder 20 (m 21b 1x4 1x6) SR: 95.23,Hardik Pandya
"slower ball, full, on off stump. India needed 17 off 16. A drive to long-on for one? Nope. Jadeja goes for the big slog, clears his front leg, goes hard, but there's no pace on the ball and he picks out the fielder at long-on",173/7,234675,47.3,c Powell b Holder 11 (m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Ravindra Jadeja
"full outside off, too full for Dhoni to get the elevation he wants, and he's hit it straight to long-on. Cleared his front leg, swung hard, and hit it flat and too close to Joseph, who moved a couple of steps to his right to take a waist-high catch",176/8,28081,48.6,c Joseph b Williams 54 (m 114b 1x4 0x6) SR: 47.36,MS Dhoni
bowled him! Off-stump yorker and Umesh slogs all around it. They check for no-ball but Holder's foot is totally fine. This is his fourth wicket. 4 for 25 in 9.1 overs.,176/9,376116,49.1, b Holder 0 (m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Umesh Yadav
"five-for! Holder's won it for West Indies! A full-toss on off stump, not the greatest ball he's bowled, but why would he care? Makes himself room, Shami, looks to hit over extra-cover, but can't clear the fielder. Side-on replays show it's just below waist-high, and that's when he's taken a stride forward",178/10,481896,49.4,c Chase b Holder 1 (m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Mohammed Shami
