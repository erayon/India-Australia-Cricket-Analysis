"oh sharp bouncer. That will be sweet to India who are usually the ones who struggle against bouncers. Khan has moved across even before the ball is delivered. Shami gets one in aimed at Khan's head. He is in position. He is ducking but can't duck. He is pulling but can't pull. The hands move in slow motion for the pull, and the ball hits the glove to lob up to Dhoni",11/1,43652,3.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Mohammed Shami 6 (13m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Younis Khan
"and Ashwin has bowled a wicket-maiden. Big breakthrough. Through a regulation classical offbreak. There is some drift, it pitches middle and leg, short of his reach, and then Sohail panics as he sees it turn sharply. He stabs at the ball with his hands following the ball, worried if he has exposed the stumps. The sharp edge is taken sharply by Raina at slip. Ashwin has bowled superbly so far",79/2,318788,17.6,c Raina b Ashwin 36 (60m 48b 3x4 0x6) SR: 75.00,Haris Sohail
"short and wide, and Shehzad has picked out Jadeja who has nearly dropped him. That is the lucky break India needed. This is a bad ball. It has been absolutely creamed but Shehzad has failed to keep it down. Jadeja lets it pop out, but he keeps his eye on it, and takes the rebound with the left hand",102/3,259410,23.2,c Jadeja b Yadav 47 (95m 73b 5x4 0x6) SR: 64.38,Ahmed Shehzad
"Yadav has got another. A nervous, poor shot from Maqsood. There is a wide slip in place, and Maqsood goes chasing at a wide shortish ball. He has not smashed it. He has played a meek push with a bat that is neither horizontal nor vertical. Raina takes the easy catch at slip",102/4,43266,23.4,c Raina b Yadav 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Sohaib Maqsood
"<b>Dhoni has reviewed this</b>. Sharp turn for Jadeja on a quick delivery. Akmal is forward, is beaten by the turn, Dhoni thinks he has edged it, and goes up immediately after breaking the wicket. He is dead sure there is an edge. The stumping was just to be sure. Not given by the umpire. The ball seams to have altered its path a smidgen as it passes the bat, but there is hardly a spike on the snicko. We don't know what long discussion between Kettleborough and the third umpire is, but he has reversed his decision in the end. Was there enough evidence to overturn the on-field call? Maybe not. Did I instinctively think there was an edge? Maybe yes",103/5,317273,24.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Jadeja 0 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Umar Akmal
"Kohli takes a special catch. Afridi is making room, gets a thigh-high full toss, which he tries to smash, gets a thick top edge over the covers. Kohli runs back. Gets under it. Has almost overrun this. Slows himself down. Takes this over his shoulder and dives. He comes up and celebrates with his arms spread out. Almost like Afridi. Maybe exactly like Afridi. Maybe on purpose",149/6,42639,34.1,c Kohli b Mohammed Shami 22 (39m 22b 1x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Shahid Afridi
"another one bites the dust. Short, wide, looks to cut, gets the edge",154/7,43590,34.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Mohammed Shami 4 (2m 2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200.00,Wahab Riaz
Shah goes. Drills this length ball straight down the throat of mid-on. Two strikes away from the inevitable,203/8,43685,42.5,c Yadav b MM Sharma 13 (32m 23b 1x4 0x6) SR: 56.52,Yasir Shah
and Misbah misses the century again. A good bouncer. Over his left shoulder. Head high. All Misbah manages is a lob to mid-on,220/9,41378,45.4,c Rahane b Mohammed Shami 76 (118m 84b 9x4 1x6) SR: 90.47,Misbah-ul-Haq
"it's all over. India make it 6-0 in World Cups against Pakistan. Slower ball, Sohail mis-hits it, and is caught at long-on",224/10,317252,46.6,c Yadav b MM Sharma 7 (21m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 70.00,Sohail Khan
