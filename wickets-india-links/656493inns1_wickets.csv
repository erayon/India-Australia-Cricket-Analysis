"India have struck early. The SCG has erupted. It looks like it is full of Indian supporters. Those six successive dots in the last over might have had a part to play in this. This is short of a length, but fuller than the one Warner smacked for six last ball. He is still looking to play that short-arm pull, realises that the shot is not on, and just checks it. An old-style bat, and this leading edge might have died, bit with the modern Kabooms it flies off the leading edge and settles with cover",15/1,219889,3.1,c Kohli b Yadav 12 (14m 7b 1x4 1x6) SR: 171.42,David Warner
India get the breakthrough. Smith won't score a double. Yadav bowls a bouncer that finally gets head high. Smith clears the front leg to hook. Doesn't control it. The top edge settles with deep square leg. Smith raises his bat to the crowd as he walks off,197/2,267192,34.1,c RG Sharma b Yadav 105 (121m 93b 11x4 2x6) SR: 112.90,Steven Smith
"Ashwin has bowled well, and he has got the big Maxwell wicket. Good field placings, good courage to bowl slow through the air. The ball turns into the pads, he cannot play it through the off side, and doesn't bother keeping the sweep down. Straight down the lap of deep backward square it goes",232/3,325026,37.3,c Rahane b Ashwin 23 (17m 14b 3x4 1x6) SR: 164.28,Glenn Maxwell
"good sharp short ball. India are clawing back. They could still keep Australia down to a manageable total. Only Yadav has been able to hurry the batsmen with the short ball. Finch is hurried into this again. This is just outside off, chest high, and does him for the pace. The edge is taken, and caught at midwicket. A hard-working team-man innings from Finch comes to an end",233/4,5334,38.2,c Dhawan b Yadav 81 (160m 116b 7x4 1x6) SR: 69.82,Aaron Finch
"another wicket for India. This is a soft dismissal. A little luck for them. This is a short ball. Not a bouncer. No menace behind this. Only waist high. Clarke can see a four over midwicket, but just doesn't get the elevation he desires. Finds Rohit Sharma there. This is what a break in momentum does to you. Slight uncertainty, and a boundary ball has resulted in a catch in the infield",248/5,4578,42.1,c RG Sharma b MM Sharma 10 (16m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Michael Clarke
"Faulkner goes after that cameo. Yadav bowls full and straight. Fuller than a length ball, just short of a yorker. Faulkner swings across the line to go over the leg side. Misses it altogether as it tails back in. Timbah",284/6,270484,46.3, b Yadav 21 (20m 12b 3x4 1x6) SR: 175.00,James Faulkner
"slower ball, in his slot, this time he has picked the slower ball, but he has cramped him for room, and his slog settles with deep square leg. Just can't get enough power behind this shot because there is no rook available",298/7,8180,47.5,c Rahane b MM Sharma 28 (51m 30b 2x4 1x6) SR: 93.33,Shane Watson
