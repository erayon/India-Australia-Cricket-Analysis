"he's gone! His partner was ball watching and he has to pay for it! Azhar's one! India have their breakthrough. The Oval erupts. Oh, this is poor from Pakistan. There's always a single there, and Azhar had made sure of it, placing the clip to the left of square leg. And it's India's weak fielder there too - Bumrah. He basically trips over himself and falls on top of the ball. Then has the good sense to pick the right end - the keeper's - and Azhar has to walk off, muttering to himself.",128/1,39037,22.6,run out (&dagger;Dhoni/Bumrah) 59 (99m 71b 6x4 1x6) SR: 83.09,Azhar Ali
"slogged into the air - and brilliantly taken by Jadeja running back from point! Pandya has taken the BIG wicket, Zaman won't be finishing this innings off, he departs for a sparkling maiden ton - and India have a window to get back in and try to burgle the initiative again! Ugly shot, stepping away and trying to smear over the leg side, the ball was pushed a touch wide for that, and it went straight up and down behind square on the off side",200/2,512191,33.1,c Jadeja b Pandya 114 (142m 106b 12x4 3x6) SR: 107.54,Fakhar Zaman
"and he wins over the distance, too! TKO for Malik, who swats an ungainly shot high out towards deep cover for a simple catch! This was short outside off, Malik seemed to be trying to forehand smash it through the off side but sent it ballooning up and over the infield",247/3,42657,39.4,c Jadhav b Kumar 12 (29m 16b 0x4 1x6) SR: 75.00,Shoaib Malik
"the floater does it, chipped to long-off! Babar was moving around his crease, Jadhav continued to dolly the ball up innocuously, no pace on it for the batsman to work with and he sends it straight down the throat of Yuvraj standing on the boundary. No fifty for Babar, and Jadhav's, ahem, efforts pay off again",267/4,348144,42.3,c Yuvraj Singh b Jadhav 46 (84m 52b 4x4 0x6) SR: 88.46,Babar Azam
