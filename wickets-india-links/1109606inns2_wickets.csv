"gone! Looked like the legbreak again, flat and full on leg, Rohit chooses to sweep but misses it. Dhawan seemed to instructed him, if you ... Rohit absorbs what Dhawan tells him <strong>and chooses to review</strong>. No bat on that. That is another terrible review, pitches on middle and leg, hits the stumps halfway up. Three reds and Rohit throws a hundred away.",109/1,34102,15.3,lbw b Dananjaya 54 (m 45b 5x4 3x6) SR: 120.00,Rohit Sharma
"what a catch! That was perfect timing, sprinted right from the outset, ran to the ball in a straight line - as opposed to around the ball - and took the catch inches off the ground. Stunning catch. Flat down leg from Siriwardana, would have been wide had Dhawan chosen not to sweep. His top-edged lobbed towards short fine leg. That's the best moment of the ODI series for Sri Lanka",113/2,28235,16.3,c Mathews b Siriwardana 49 (m 50b 6x4 1x6) SR: 98.00,Shikhar Dhawan
"77 kph, the googly from Dananjaya and Jadhav is castled. Completely flummoxed by the fact that an offspinner is ripping googlies - well, the direction of turn is the same. He stays back, wafts with bat well away from pad, and the ball says hello to that glaring gap and goes right through to hit middle stump. That was not a good stroke, not helped by the fact that he did not have a clue of the direction of spin",114/3,290716,17.1, b Dananjaya 1 (m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Kedar Jadhav
"Kohli's gone! 4 off 2! Dananjaya spinning a web around these Indian batsmen. What's happening. Yikes. Wow. Another googly, this one is soooo full but Kohli still does not manage to get bat on that. It's full and straight, Kohli takes his pads away from the line of the ball, looking for that trademark whippy cover drive, but all that does it create a massive bat-pad gap and the stumps are disturbed again. SL in raptures.",118/4,253802,17.3, b Dananjaya 4 (m 2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200.00,Virat Kohli
"74 kph, Rahul this time does not read the googly. And India are in trouble. Sensational control of the googly, so good that the length is just terrific - it's full but not full enough that Rahul can smother the turn, it's not short, definitely not short enough for Rahul to go back. It spins back in prodigiously, clips the pad and knocks into the stumps. <b>5 wickets in 15 balls</b>. Aaaah, wow.",119/5,422108,17.5, b Dananjaya 4 (m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Lokesh Rahul
"five for Dananjaya. And India are in utter shambles. It was Ajantha Mendis in Galle! It's Dananjaya in Pallekele! The power of wristpin. It's surprise, surprise, another googly. Pandya runs down to the pitch, but does not get there. Hey, guess what that does? It creates <b>yet another bat-pad gap</b>. The snake of a googly finds that gap, and settles nicely in Dickwella's gloves. Pandya was not reading that, thought he could smother the spin but the bowler was clever enough to drag that length back.",121/6,625371,19.3,st &dagger;Dickwella b Dananjaya 0 (m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Hardik Pandya
"86 kph, the non-turning offbreak? Who cares, say Sri Lanka. Axar can't review even if he wants to. Yes, it is. The non-turning offbreak on off, flat and full, draws Axar forward, beats the bat on the inside edge and strikes him in front of off. Sri Lanka have formed a circle with enough energy to power those floodlights that failed in the CPL earlier today. Akila has six!",131/7,554691,21.5,lbw b Dananjaya 6 (m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Axar Patel
