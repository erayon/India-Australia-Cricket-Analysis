"Mustafizur has got Sharma for the third time this series. A loose shot from Sharma. Just when he had looked like he was starting to pick the cutter early, he goes for a big shot to a wide length ball, which angles away to take the edge. Just not the same alertness as he has shown earlier in the day. A break in concentration. Not good news for India that the batsmen are not concentrating for long enough",39/1,34102,6.6,c &dagger;Liton Das b Mustafizur Rahman 29 (34m 29b 2x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Rohit Sharma
"tries the big slog sweep, but the slowness of the wily Shakib has done him in. Kohli has not been fluent, but he needs to look at the scoreboard. The team is going at six an over. There is no need to play such expansive shots. He is too early into the slog sweep, and is beaten all ends up. Timbah",114/2,253802,19.5, b Shakib Al Hasan 25 (55m 35b 1x4 0x6) SR: 71.42,Virat Kohli
"Dhawan is a touch unlucky. Nasir Hossain pulls off another stunner. Similar to the Rahane catch in the first game. This is a slower offcutter, but this is pitched halfway in the pitch, and Dhawan can hit this wherever he wants to. He chooses midwicket, looks to go over the man, but Hossain is not just a man. He is a plane. He is a bird. He is a fox who has become a tiger. He is superman. He takes the catch at short midwicket",158/3,28235,26.5,c Nasir Hossain b Mashrafe Mortaza 75 (118m 73b 10x4 0x6) SR: 102.73,Shikhar Dhawan
"Rayudu is really angry. Think he will lose some of his match fee, and he will also have to do with the disappointment of having being sawn off. He moves across the stumps to look to hit it over short fine, Mortaza bowls the slower ball to beat him, and the umpire has given him out caught off the thigh pad. Ball is in Mirpur, bat is in Dhaka, but he has been given out. Rayudu really really angry. Dhoni also seen staring at the umpire",251/4,33141,43.3,c &dagger;Liton Das b Mashrafe Mortaza 44 (74m 49b 3x4 0x6) SR: 89.79,Ambati Rayudu
"Mustafizur is everywhere. This time he takes a superb catch off a legcutter. Think this is the first time Mortaza has bowled the slower legcutter today. Dhoni has been picking the offcutter well, but this one he doesn't and gets a massive leading edge that flies towards deep midwicket. Mustafizur comes in from the rope and dives forward to take this inches form the ground",268/5,28081,45.2,c Mustafizur Rahman b Mashrafe Mortaza 69 (112m 77b 6x4 1x6) SR: 89.61,MS Dhoni
"timbah. He has defeated him completely. The ball arrives an eternity after Raina has swung across the line. Beats the slog, hits the stumps. No. 13 for Mustafizur. Equals Harris' record for 13 wickets in three matches in a series, but Harris played three matches in a five-match series. Mustafizur has done this in a three-match series",301/6,33335,48.4, b Mustafizur Rahman 38 (26m 21b 3x4 2x6) SR: 180.95,Suresh Raina
