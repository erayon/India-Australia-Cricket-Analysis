"edged and taken at second slip. Good, low catch by Stokes. Good length angled in on off, seams away slightly, Rahul is stapled to the crease and is squared up. Woakes earns the outside edge and Stokes dives low to his left to snaffle it. Plucked it inches from the ground",14/1,422108,2.1,c Stokes b Woakes 5 (11m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Lokesh Rahul
"Stokes nabs Kohli now. This is a huuuuuge scalp. Second slip dives low to his left and clings onto it with both hands. This is very, very full and wide outside off - a near yorker - Kohli reaches out and jabs his bat down on the ball. Takes the outside edge, Stokes is late to react but pouches it. No feet from Kohli. The Cuttack crowd has been hushed into silence",22/2,253802,2.6,c Stokes b Woakes 8 (6m 5b 2x4 0x6) SR: 160.00,Virat Kohli
follows two short balls with a very full ball - hangs it up outside off - Dhawan's feet stapled to the crease again. He reaches out with his hands. Throws his bat at a big cover drive and ends up dragging the ball back onto the stumps via a thick inside edge. The off stump is floored. The drop does not cost England. This is some start for Woakes and his team,25/3,28235,4.4, b Woakes 11 (24m 15b 2x4 0x6) SR: 73.33,Shikhar Dhawan
"full and outside off, Yuvraj looks to drive it down the ground. He can only nick it behind to the keeper. It was in the slot, but Yuvraj's execution was off for a change. End of a crackling innings",281/4,36084,42.6,c &dagger;Buttler b Woakes 150 (183m 127b 21x4 3x6) SR: 118.11,Yuvraj Singh

"full-toss on the leg stump, Dhoni picks it up and swipes it into the hands of Willey at deep square leg. Dhoni wrings his hands in pain, did not get the desired power behind that hit. Nevertheless, Dhoni walks back to a rousing reception",358/6,28081,47.6,c Willey b Plunkett 134 (203m 122b 10x4 6x6) SR: 109.83,MS Dhoni
