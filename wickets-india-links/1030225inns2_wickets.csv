"beauty from Southee. Perfect outswinger. Short of a driving length, just outside off, Sharma plays defensively from the crease. The ball moves away to take the outside edge. This is really good bowling. This is late swing, and Sharma follows it with his hands",19/1,34102,4.1,c &dagger;Watling b Southee 11 (15m 19b 2x4 0x6) SR: 57.89,Rohit Sharma
"and gone. Kohli falls. Short and wide outside off, a terrible delivery. Kohli goes back and gets a thin edge which is well taken by Watling. Not much turn, but there may have been some extra bounce, or Kohli just played for some. Either way, what was turning into another typical Kohli chase has been cut short, almost literally.",98/2,253802,19.5,c &dagger;Watling b Sodhi 45 (64m 51b 2x4 1x6) SR: 88.23,Virat Kohli
"given this time. The change has worked. Looked pretty close. Rahane fails to convert a solid start into a  big score, Yes, good decision by umpire Oxenford. Full and straight - towards middle and off. Rahane comes forward and shuffles across to reduce the distance from a plausible offcutter, but Neesham bowls this seam-up. It skids on and strikes Rahane in front of middle, no problem with height. Out.",128/3,277916,27.2,lbw b Neesham 57 (108m 70b 5x4 1x6) SR: 81.42,Ajinkya Rahane
"gets through. Massive wicket. Dhoni falls. The crowd goes silent. Just a straight delivery on leg. Seam-up, Dhoni doesn't move his feet, drives at the ball but the ball finds a way through the bat and pad gap to clatter into leg stump. A big play from Neesham. May have got that to seam back in just enough.",135/4,28081,29.2, b Neesham 11 (36m 31b 0x4 0x6) SR: 35.48,MS Dhoni
"one more. Pandey has picked out mid-on and Pandey cannot believe it. Superb catch. A slower delivery outside off, was way too full and Pandey saw an opportunity to loft the ball over mid-on. It ended up a tad too full and Pandey was unable to get underneath that. Drilled his drive, but Latham leaped up at just the right time to take a great catch with both hands well over his head. Timed his jump to perfection, had to because Pandey got plenty on it. India stumbling again",154/5,290630,32.2,c Latham b Southee 12 (13m 12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Manish Pandey
"plumb in front. Jadhav has to go. An offcutter on middle, Jadhav just plain misses a straight delivery. Keeps low too. Southee takes pace off the ball, Jadhav is late on his attempted nudge and the ball raps him in front of middle. At worst, would be hitting leg stump. A double strike for NZ.",154/6,290716,32.3,lbw b Southee 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Kedar Jadhav
"oh it looks like a good shot but the fielding - both the placement and the effort - is even better. Pandya jumps out of the crease and goes inside out with the turn, but doesn't place it as wide as he would have liked. Latham is wide at long-off, and judges his run to his left perfectly to take complete this catch between where long-off and deep extra cover",167/7,625371,35.6,c Latham b Santner 9 (18m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 69.23,Hardik Pandya
"and this run-out has sent India closer to a defeat. And this run-out is not because Mishra is slow. Patel pulls and when he does so he is deep in his crease. It is pulled to the left of Santner at deep square leg. he has to get a sliding save in, which means there is an opportunity for two but because Patel gets a late start to his first run he turns down the second. Mishra is left with nowhere to go. Patel does give the second a go but the moment he sees he has to run around Boult he says no. Santner's impressive tour continues",205/8,31107,42.1,run out (Santner/&dagger;Watling) 14 (29m 17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 82.35,Amit Mishra
"full, fast and that's the game. Finally through Patel. He has fought hard but it has come to an end here. Boult spears this in, Patel looks to whip it, but is late into the shot. The ball hits his pad and ricochets into the off stump",207/9,554691,42.3, b Boult 38 (77m 40b 3x4 1x6) SR: 95.00,Axar Patel
"and a big wind-up it is but the slower ball has been mis-hit straight to extra cover to level the series. Boult just too good for No. 11 with that asking rate that high. Slower, on a length, and it has been sliced",241/10,376116,48.4,c Taylor b Boult 7 (26m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 58.33,Umesh Yadav
