"somehow Dhawan chips his wicket away! It's yet another offcutter outside off, Dhawan shimmies down and looks to hit over mid-off but the ball skews off the outside half and goes towards point's left. That cut, off the ball, may have been the reason for the ball going to point, as opposed to mid-off.",87/1,28235,14.4,c Mosaddek Hossain b Mashrafe Mortaza 46 (67m 34b 7x4 1x6) SR: 135.29,Shikhar Dhawan
