"outswinger with loads of extra extra bounce nabs Chibhabha. He is crease-bound as he spars at it and gets a thickish outside edge, which flies to Rahane at second slip. Good, sharp catch around head height",16/1,55354,4.5,c Rahane b Kumar 3 (18m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Chamu Chibhabha
"Binny strikes back! Dragged short, not much bite in it. It should have been put away, instead Sibanda mis-hits the pull. Harbhajan swallows it at mid-on. Good overhead catch",47/2,55787,12.2,c Harbhajan Singh b Binny 20 (52m 35b 2x4 1x6) SR: 57.14,Vusi Sibanda
Hami M falls. Alarming <i>turn and bounce</i>. Might have held up in the pitch as well. Hami M was surprised by it as he just chips it tamely to Tiwary at point off the outside half of the bat. Hami M yanked his bottom hand off the bat as he met the ball,89/3,55608,22.6,c Tiwary b Patel 34 (66m 64b 4x4 0x6) SR: 53.12,Hamilton Masakadza
"Axar takes out Williams for a duck. He gives this more air outside off, grips in the surface and rips through the bat-pad gap to hit the top of middle and off. Zimbabwe fall behind in the chase",94/4,55870,24.2, b Patel 0 (7m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Sean Williams
"another half-tracker, Raza goes for a pull and gifts his wicket. He makes a mess of the pull as he mistimes it in the air. Axar runs in from deep midwicket, flings himself forward and snaps it up. First ODI wicket for Harbhajan in four years",142/5,299572,32.5,c Patel b Harbhajan Singh 37 (31m 33b 5x4 0x6) SR: 112.12,Sikandar Raza
Binny rolls his fingers across this one. Mutumbai targets the leg side with a flick but ends up spooning a leading edge to Harbhajan at mid-off. He runs to his right and takes it. They check for a possible no-ball. Binny is okay,160/6,235516,37.4,c Harbhajan Singh b Binny 7 (23m 16b 1x4 0x6) SR: 43.75,Richmond Mutumbami
"What have you done Cremer? Full toss outside the leg stump, he goes for a reverse-sweep and hits it right into the lap of  Binny at backward point. The wide has helped him get the wicket, but India needed Chigumbura's wicket",246/7,55346,48.6,c Binny b Kulkarni 27 (54m 36b 2x4 0x6) SR: 75.00,Graeme Cremer
