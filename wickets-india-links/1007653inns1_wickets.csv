"poor shot, and Masakadza has thrown it away again by falling into the trap. It was floated full and wide, the invitation was there to drive as there was no cover fielder, but all Masakadza could do was get a thick edge that was pouched quite comfortably by Rahul at slip. He went hard at that, but the head was all over the place as he made contact.",19/1,55608,5.3,c Rahul b Kulkarni 8 (23m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 44.44,Hamilton Masakadza
"first signs of intent, and he's holded out to Bumrah who takes a good catch at the ropes at long-off. It was beautifully tossed up, the ball swerved away a touch as well as Sibanda got to the pitch, but didn't generate enough power on the stroke as he looked to loft it over the ropes. He was also hitting it towards the bigger straight boundary, where Bumrah, mindful of the ropes behind him, moved a couple of steps backwards to pouch that. The pressure was building, and Chibhabha has fallen into the trap.",55/2,55354,20.1,c Bumrah b Chahal 27 (83m 66b 3x4 0x6) SR: 40.90,Chamu Chibhabha
"a dismissal any legspinner would be proud of. This was generously tossed up, but the batsman had to lunge forward to get to the pitch. But Sibanda made the mistake of looking to work it across the line and closed the bat face a little too early, only to see the ball lob back to the bowler off the leading edge. Second wicket for Chahal, who continues to impress. He was denied a wicket in the last over, but it doesn't take long for him to strike back. <b> Chahal put him down on nought, but now has his man! </b> Sweet revenge",89/3,55787,28.4,c &amp; b Chahal 38 (85m 71b 2x4 1x6) SR: 53.52,Vusi Sibanda
"got him! That's a beauty. He has got the ball to cut back in all afternoon, and has been finally rewarded. There was no conviction whatsoever from Maruma who pushes outside the line of the stumps, only to see the ball break back in to sneak through and flatten the off stump. He made the mistake of simply hanging his bat out, and paid the price",104/4,235524,32.5, b Bumrah 17 (42m 29b 1x4 0x6) SR: 58.62,Timycen Maruma
"sets him up superbly! He was waiting for a short one and was well inside the crease. Bumrah does well to float it full as the ball tails away just a touch to take the edge through to MS Dhoni. 350th victim for the Indian captain. Smiles all around. Chigumbura is out for another duck, his poor run of form continues. Zimbabwe on a free-fall, not for the first time in the series.",104/5,55343,32.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b Bumrah 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Elton Chigumbura
"what is happening? Zimbabwe are committing hara-kiri here. Waller takes off for a single as soon as he hits it to cover, but is partner is guilty of ball-watching. He was more than halfway down the pitch when sent back. KL Rahul, moving to his left, had enough time to lob the throw to Dhoni, who whipped the bails off. Waller indicates to his partner that there was clearly a run there as it was hit wide of the fielder. He mumbles a few words as he walks off.",104/6,55872,33.1,run out (Rahul/&dagger;Dhoni) 8 (20m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 53.33,Malcolm Waller
"Castle Corner is outraged, and they have every reason to be. Typical Axar Patel delivery. He drifts this one into off stump from wide of the crease, Cremer is caught on the crease as he prods outside the line of the delivery that skids on to hit the pad. As plumb as it can get! He may have not had his pads on five minutes back. Now he has all the time in the world to take them off. Poor from Zimbabwe",104/7,55346,33.2,lbw b Patel 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Graeme Cremer
"beautiful ball from Bumrah. This one holds its line after pitching on off, Mutumbami is drawn forward by the length and gets thick edge as Rahul dives low to his left to complete the catch at slip . The ball flew off the bat, but Rahul kept his eyes on the ball right till it lodged into his hands. He put down a few the other day, both at training and in the match, but has looked much sharper today.",108/8,235516,34.3,c Rahul b Bumrah 4 (8m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33,Richmond Mutumbami
"outside edge, and gone again. This time, it's Pandey at second slip. Mupariwa goes for an expansive drive again, but looked to do so with an opened-face, was clearly beaten by the pace of the ball as the edge flew into Pandey's safe hands. Bumrah is having a field day, and the angles have once again worked wonderfully for him. He's had a few nip back in, while others have held their line to cause the confusion. Top stuff this",110/9,55652,36.4,c Pandey b Bumrah 1 (8m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.11,Tawanda Mupariwa
"what athleticism from Dhawal Kulkarni! Sprints across on his follow-through to pick up the ball, then turn around and fire a throw at the bowler's end, and he's hit the stumps. Not sure what Tiripano was thinking, but a dive could have saved him there. He also made the mistake of running diagonally, and that may have cost him a yard or two",123/10,392945,42.2,run out (Kulkarni) 2 (20m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 12.50,Donald Tiripano
