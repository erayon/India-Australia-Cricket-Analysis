"there's the wicket that has been brought about by uncertainty outside off. Guptill is squared up as he jabs at the length delivery that flies to Rohit at second slip. There was a juggle, but he managed to hold on. Excellent comeback from Pandya",14/1,226492,1.6,c Sharma b Pandya 12 (11m 11b 3x4 0x6) SR: 109.09,Martin Guptill
"it doesn't come much simpler than that at third man. Width on offer, Williamson slashed and the edge flew straight down Mishra's throat. He didn't have to move an inch.",29/2,277906,4.6,c Mishra b Yadav 3 (15m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Kane Williamson
"got 'im first ball. What a jaffa from Umesh Yadav. On a good length outside off, the ball moves away just enough, like it has been doing all afternoon. Taylor sees the length, thinks he can lay bat on ball but the out swing takes the edge of his prodding bat. Not much can be done about that to be fair. India's seamers on point so far, extracting just enough away movement",33/3,38699,6.1,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 0 (7m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Ross Taylor
"<b>superb catch from Umesh!</b> A tad too exuberant from Anderson. Full and wide outside off, was there to be hit but Anderson couldn't quite get under that. Hammers his drive straight to Umesh at mid-off, who dives to his right and somehow clings on to his reverse-cupped catch at head height. Wrong shot selection. Latham has been timing those cover drives all day. Anderson looked to muscle it.",43/4,277662,10.4,c Yadav b Pandya 4 (22m 14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 28.57,Corey Anderson
"this is catching practice to say the least. Ronchi checked his shot and ended up flicking it straight to Umesh at mid-on. This was much simpler and came straight back at him at a friendly pace. Ronchi's bat face turned slightly, perhaps done in for pace again. What a debut Hardik Pandya is having",48/5,7502,12.1,c Yadav b Pandya 0 (9m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Luke Ronchi
"he was denied a wicket in the last over, but it doesn't cost India much. This one holds onto the surface just a touch and Neesham chips the simplest of return catches to the bowler. <B> First ODI wicket for Jadhav </b>",65/6,355269,18.3,c &amp; b Jadhav 10 (27m 25b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,James Neesham
"two in two! Unbelievable, isn't it? This one skids straight on, Santner shapes to cut but it was too close for him to play it and only managed a faint tickle through to Dhoni. <b> Kedar on a hat-trick </b> and he can't believe his luck.",65/7,502714,18.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Jadhav 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mitchell Santner
"and that should be out! Certainly looked like it lobbed to midwicket. The question is <b>whether it was a bump ball.</b> Tosses up on middle and leg, Bracewell comes to the pitch, gets there but is undone by the length. Ends up chipping a simple catch to Rahane at midwicket, who was certain it wasn't a bump ball. Does not lob up to a fielder if it is hit into the ground. NZ slump further",106/8,362541,31.5,c Rahane b Mishra 15 (42m 46b 0x4 0x6) SR: 32.60,Doug Bracewell
"why would you try to do that when runs are coming quite easily? Beyond me. Anyway, Southee looks to go over long-on but the turn does him in as the leading edge skews towards Pandey, who takes a good catch running backwards from cover. End of a super stand, a super revival for NZ, but is it enough?",177/9,232364,41.3,c Pandey b Mishra 55 (36m 45b 6x4 3x6) SR: 122.22,Tim Southee
"the top spinner has done the trick for Mishra. You expect Sodhi, of all people, to pick those but he had no clue whatsoever. Shapes to cut but the ball kept coming back in to hit the pad and he was trapped plumb in front of middle. Umpire Shamsuddin won't get to make easier decisions than that",190/10,559066,43.5,lbw b Mishra 1 (12m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10.00,Ish Sodhi
