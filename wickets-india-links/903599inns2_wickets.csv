"pulled to the leg side and straight to midwicket, the crowd has come alive! It was short around off, Amla got into position nicely to pull and Dhawan had to jump just a bit to catch with both hands",36/1,43906,5.1,c Dhawan b MM Sharma 7 (24m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 70.00,Hashim Amla
"Harbhajan was on the prowl and Jinxy the Cat takes it at second slip! Nicely tossed up outside off, QdK is tempted for the drive and he goes for it too, edging the ball to slips",67/2,379143,11.3,c Rahane b Harbhajan Singh 43 (54m 35b 6x4 1x6) SR: 122.85,Quinton de Kock
"big appeal and the finger goes up! Faf barely moved his feet for the length delivery outside off, it turned away sharply as Faf poked his bat and Dhoni went up as soon as he pouched it. Faf shows his displeasure by raising his right arm and says something too. Replays show there was some noise when the ball went past the bat, Snicko also shows there was something",79/3,44828,14.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Patel 17 (45m 34b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Faf du Plessis
"oh, that's the other one, it doesn't turn but goes the other way after pitching on off and hit him right in front of middle stump on the front foot. The players appeal, the crowd appeals and Ravi's finger goes up",88/4,321777,17.6,lbw b Harbhajan Singh 6 (10m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,David Miller

"loud appeal for lbw, he survives that and is looking down while AB wants a run, he has his arms in the air as if saying, ""why aren't you running?"" Morris realises that too late and takes off but there's a direct hit at the non-striker's end. And who was the fielder at point? Jinxy the Cat!",185/6,439952,38.1,run out (Rahane) 9 (27m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Chris Morris
"he's got the big wicket, AB is caught behind off a short ball after a fighting and valiant century! The bouncer seamed in, AB went for the pull and got an edge for Dhoni to take it low in front of him. AB gets a standing ovation as he waves his bat around",233/7,44936,44.3,c &dagger;Dhoni b Kumar 112 (128m 107b 10x4 2x6) SR: 104.67,AB de Villiers
