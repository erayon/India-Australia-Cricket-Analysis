"looks to flay this through the line over point but can only slice this to deep third man. Pushpakumara, the debutant, takes an excellent catch on the move. The ball was flying. The bat face opened as ball met bat, the late movement did the trick for the bowler.",6/1,28235,1.3,c Pushpakumara b Fernando 4 (m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Shikhar Dhawan
"gone! Malinga has his 300th wicket! Not the greatest delivery he's ever bowled, but he won't mind - he's found a way to break this partnership. A full, wide ball, and Kohli drives in the air, straight to the sweeper on the cover point boundary",225/2,253802,29.3,c Munaweera b Malinga 131 (m 96b 17x4 2x6) SR: 136.45,Virat Kohli
"this time, he's picked out the man at deep midwicket. Walked across the stumps to fetch the pull, this was a slower delivery so he had to force the pace. Hit it well but found the fielder. Pandya has a look of disbelief, as if to say 'how did I find the fielder.' His father is a picture of disappointment in the stands. <b> The Dananjaya drop doesn't prove costly, after all </b>",262/3,625371,34.3,c de Silva b Mathews 19 (m 18b 1x4 1x6) SR: 105.55,Hardik Pandya
has he feathered this? Yes he has. Two in two. Looks to arch back and glide this short ball over the keeper's head but the lack of pace has done him in. Just ends up being a straightforward catch to the keeper. Rohit started walking  immediately. Double-strike for Sri Lanka courtesy a man with wonky knees.,262/4,34102,34.4,c &dagger;Dickwella b Mathews 104 (m 88b 11x4 3x6) SR: 118.18,Rohit Sharma
"chipped straight to midwicket. The freefall continues. Rahul's third failure in the series, out to Dananjaya again. This was the wrong'un that didn't spin as much, Rahul picked it and looked to hit it with the spin but he was trying to do so from outside off, only managed to hit it straight to the fielder.",274/5,422108,37.4,c de Silva b Dananjaya 7 (m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 87.50,Lokesh Rahul
