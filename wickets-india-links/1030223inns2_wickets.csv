"that's all a bit soft! And Henry proves game-changing for New Zealand again. He was celebrating the moment Rahane popped this back of a length ball in the air. It went in the direction of cover, and Santner was the man there. He's a fantastic fielder. Perhaps this pitch isn't quite as true as I thought. That ball certainly stopped on Rahane",13/1,277916,2.5,c Santner b Henry 5 (11m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Ajinkya Rahane
"slower ball has him lbw! Lovely change of pace. Rohit didn't quite pick it early enough, and his attempt at adjusting to it comes up short because Southee has also given this ball a bit of offcut. The flick shot comes down outside the line of the ball. He is pinned in line with middle and leg. Umpire Oxenford takes his time but then gives the nod",41/2,34102,8.4,lbw b Southee 13 (35m 21b 2x4 0x6) SR: 61.90,Rohit Sharma
"he's struck! With that back of a length ball that New Zealand like. And it is precisely for this reason that they like it - some hold onto the dry pitch and if a batsman is driving on the up, there is every chance he could be caught. That's why they have a short cover in the 36th over. Dhoni was left reaching for the ball, mistimes the shot and Taylor takes the catch",192/3,28081,35.5,c Taylor b Henry 80 (122m 91b 6x4 3x6) SR: 87.91,MS Dhoni
