"Sran finally gets his man. This one was full and swinging back in again, Moor is stuck on the crease as he looks to work it across the line and is trapped plumb in front of middle. This time umpire Tiffin is certain that it would have hit the stumps. Reward for Sran's persistence",8/1,333000,1.6,lbw b Sran 3 (10m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Peter Moor
"some reward, finally. Kept shaping the ball away but all he saw was the batsman either being squared up or leave the ball. This time, the ball is just around the off stump, Masakadza simply had no option but to play at it, and it was a very feeble push as the ball took the edge through to Dhoni, who had to move forward to take the catch. Signs of the surface being two-paced? I'm not sure, but Masakadza's misery is over. Excellent from Dhawal, Dhoni's decision to give him a fifth over has been justified.",30/2,55608,8.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Kulkarni 14 (29m 21b 2x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Hamilton Masakadza
"the off stump has been flattened! This one was full from wide of the crease, Chibhabha planted his foot forward but was late on the defensive shot as the ball sneaks past the inside edge to deflect onto the stumps off the pad. The late inswing did him in. Zimbabwe in trouble.",47/3,55354,13.1, b Bumrah 13 (61m 42b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.95,Chamu Chibhabha
"there's the wicket, and you have to say lack of temperament has resulted in that. It was short and wide, there to play the cut, but Sibanda was undone by the extra bounce as the thick edge is pouched by Dhoni. Sibanda made a mistake of going under the ball rather than getting on top of the bounce.",69/4,55787,19.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Bumrah 5 (25m 21b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.80,Vusi Sibanda
"poor delivery, but he's got a wicket against the run of play. Ervine was looking for a release shot. In all fairness this was a delivery to be hit. It was short on middle, he shaped to pull and made good contact, but he was hitting it towards the longer boundary. Faiz Fazal, the substitute fielder, had to contend with the sun in his eyes, but positioned himself well by moving backwards and to his left, and made the catch look easier than it was. The ball was struck hard but he had no doubts whatsoever with his catching technique. Axar has a sheepish smile on his face, heart of hearts, he knew that didn't really deserve a wicket.",77/5,55412,23.6,c sub (FY Fazal) b Patel 21 (63m 45b 1x4 0x6) SR: 46.66,Craig Ervine
"he's played on! This was a friendly full delivery on off stump, Raza went hard at that but his head was all over the place, wasn't looking down on the ball as he made contact and only managed a thick inside edge that cannoned into the stumps.",115/6,299572,37.3, b Sran 23 (61m 54b 2x4 0x6) SR: 42.59,Sikandar Raza
"if anyone deserved a wicket, it was Chahal. He has a big smile on his face as KL Rahul completes a regulation catch at long-off. This was generously tossed up outside off, Mutumbami looked to clear the ropes but only managed to hit it off the toe end of the bat. Rahul only had to move a couple of paces to his left to complete the catch. Chahal is off the mark in international cricket.",140/7,235516,43.3,c Rahul b Chahal 15 (23m 27b 2x4 0x6) SR: 55.55,Richmond Mutumbami
"gave away his intentions of walking across to scoop too early, and has missed a straight one. Dhawal floated it at length on middle, and once Cremer hit, there was little hope of surviving. He was completely blinded as he looked to help it over short fine, and missed it altogether.",156/8,55346,46.5, b Kulkarni 8 (14m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 72.72,Graeme Cremer
"'you miss and I hit' stuff. Length ball on middle from wide of the crease, Chigumbura shaped to pull but the ball cut back in to beat the inside edge and hit leg stump. Industrious knock, but couldn't get the impetus",167/9,55343,49.3, b Bumrah 41 (99m 65b 1x4 0x6) SR: 63.07,Elton Chigumbura
"excellent calling from Rayudu. He ensured he called early to get underneath that mistimed skier, but it wasn't easy as he was looking into the sun while running in from mid-on. But ensured he kept his eyes on the ball, made the late adjustment by moving back a touch to complete the catch. Best bowling figures for Bumrah",168/10,425639,49.5,c Rayudu b Bumrah 4 (18m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Tendai Chatara
