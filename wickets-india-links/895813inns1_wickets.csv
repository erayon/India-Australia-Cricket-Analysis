"bowled him! Warner mows across the line but the length is not short enough as the ball angles across him, he inside edges it on to middle stump. Finally some respite for India ... Warner returns to the team with an innings that has set Australia up for a huge score",187/1,219889,29.3, b I Sharma 93 (120m 92b 12x4 1x6) SR: 101.08,David Warner
"Ishant takes the catch from mid-on. Good length on off, Finch goes for the pull but the ball bounces and takes the outside half. The ball lobs up and Ishant runs around from mid-on, even as Kohli from midwicket was running back. Ishant keeps his eyes on the ball and hangs on comfortably. And then has a word with Kohli. Big wicket, nonetheless, and a very timely one",221/2,5334,37.3,c I Sharma b Yadav 107 (153m 107b 9x4 2x6) SR: 100.00,Aaron Finch
"slogged to long-on. Virat takes an easy catch running in.l Another slower delivery outside off, Marsh goes for the sweep but can only lob it up. The ball took the outside half the bat, and the bat turned in his hands which contributed to the lack of distance. Marsh's middling innings ends",288/3,272450,44.3,c Kohli b Yadav 33 (62m 42b 3x4 0x6) SR: 78.57,Mitchell Marsh
"taken. Very good catch from Gurkeerat at fine leg. A nothing delivery on middle stump, Smith goes for the heave but gets a top edge which flies to fine leg. Goes very high in the air and hangs there for quite a while. Mann backtracks, comes forward, backtracks and takes it",298/4,267192,45.4,c Gurkeerat Singh b I Sharma 51 (37m 29b 4x4 3x6) SR: 175.86,Steven Smith
"misses his length this time does Ishant but he gets a wicket. Full on middle, Bailey smashes it high in the air towards long-on, Rohit runs around and takes a good catch. Great over this, but 11 still come off it.",319/5,4451,47.6,c RG Sharma b I Sharma 10 (11m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 142.85,George Bailey
"'Finisher Faulkner' goes for a golden globe. Nice slower delivery on middle, Faulkner gets down to try and sweep but the ball keeps a touch low and sneaks through to rattle into the stumps.",319/6,270484,48.1, b Yadav 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,James Faulkner
"gone. Wade is run out this time. Slower delivery outside off, played towards point. Maxi calls Wade through. Wade is a little slow to get off and pays for it with his wicket. Rohit returns the throw on the bounce, and Yadav backtracks to the wicket to take the bails off. Good work",321/7,230193,48.3,run out (RG Sharma/Yadav) 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Matthew Wade
"what a catch from Pandey to finish. Just a sensational catch. Length on middle, Maxi pulls but doesn't get all if it again, his feet is parallel to the ground as he flies for the take. Great grab. But Maxwell has played a blinder",348/8,325026,49.6,c sub (MK Pandey) b I Sharma 41 (29m 20b 6x4 1x6) SR: 205.00,Glenn Maxwell
