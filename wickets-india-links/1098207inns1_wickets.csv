"got him, lovely bowling. Nurse flights this one, just outside off, draws Dhawan forward. He's looking to drive into the covers, but it's bowled slower than his usual delivery, and dips a little shorter, turns past his outside edge as he reaches out, and the reaching out has dragged his back foot out of the crease. Hope takes no time in whipping the bails off",114/1,28235,18.2,st &dagger;Hope b Nurse 63 (m 59b 10x4 0x6) SR: 106.77,Shikhar Dhawan
"what's happened there? A single bail has come out and the other one wobbles before settling down on middle stump. Rahane was shaping for the pull shot. It was short, yes, but perhaps too close. Gets tucked up for room and makes no contact. The ball just about kisses the bail. Barely comes out, but comes out nonetheless, and that is enough",211/2,277916,33.6, b Cummins 103 (m 104b 10x4 2x6) SR: 99.03,Ajinkya Rahane
gets another outside edge and this time it is snaffled at third man. He came out throwing his hands at everything and West Indies kept firing it wide and taking it out of his reach. Throws everything at this wide delivery and looks to flay it over the off side. All he can manage is pop a catch to Miguel Cummins,223/3,625371,34.6,c Cummins b Joseph 4 (m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Hardik Pandya
"is that an edge? Yes, there is. There was a definite sound and it has been given. Length ball, fired wide outside off, it is angled in from wide of the crease before moving slightly away and holding its line. Yuvraj slashes and finds a weather to the keeper",254/4,36084,38.1,c &dagger;Hope b Holder 14 (m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 140.00,Yuvraj Singh
"holes out to long-on looking for another big six. Slower ball from Joseph, rolls his fingers over the seam and the ball does not come on too well as a result. Tries to launch it and gets the elevation but not the distance. Nurse settles under it comfortably",285/5,253802,41.2,c Nurse b Joseph 87 (m 66b 4x4 4x6) SR: 131.81,Virat Kohli
