so many catches flying around and now QdK has taken a <b>stunner</b>!

"and the change works - Steyn has got him caught behind! There was some room, Rahane went for the shot without moving his feet much and the ball stayed a tad low to take the bottom edge and QdK took it with both hands, Steyn is pumped after a long time",139/3,277916,26.1,c &dagger;de Kock b Steyn 45 (79m 53b 4x4 0x6) SR: 84.90,Ajinkya Rahane

"oh Harbhajan is bowled down the leg side! He wanted to tuck the ball to leg with the angle, and the ball deflected off his pads to the stumps. The umpires are checking for a no ball, and Rabada has overstepped here, nothing behind the line when his heel lands. Oh, hello! He's still been given out. Can't figure out the reason why that's not a no ball and the TV commentators are confused too",291/6,29264,48.3, b Rabada 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Harbhajan Singh
