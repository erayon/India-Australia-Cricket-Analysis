"Harbhajan strikes, Rahane pouches it at backward point. Harbhajan tosses this up generously outside off, some turn as well, Miller has a crack at it but his bat twists and he slices it off the outside half of the bat as Rahane moves to his right, tumbles forward to snaffle it. The strong opening stand has been broken. Who will come in at No.3?",72/1,321777,13.3,c Rahane b Harbhajan Singh 33 (57m 41b 4x4 0x6) SR: 80.48,David Miller
"Dhoni takes the bails off in a flash. Amla can't drag his back foot back in time. The spinners have slowed the visitors down. Flatter at 94.6ks and spins away, Amla loses his balance as he aims to drive it through the off side. He does not connect, neither can he pull his back foot in time. The TV umpire is called in and Amla departs",87/2,43906,18.4,st &dagger;Dhoni b Mishra 5 (21m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Hashim Amla
"Faf looks to hit the repeat button, this time he finds short third man. Faf shuffles across off again, this time his balance is foiled and he topples over.. He skewers it in the air, popping a catch to short third man running back",205/3,44828,38.5,c Kumar b MM Sharma 60 (89m 63b 6x4 0x6) SR: 95.23,Faf du Plessis
"Dhawan, who had dropped a tough chance to let Faf off, makes amends by running QdK out. This was pushed through on an off-stump line, AB works it towards short midwicket, where Dhawan flings to his left and stops the ball. QdK was late to respond, as Dhawan throws ball over to Dhoni. QdK is caught short",210/4,379143,39.6,run out (Dhawan/&dagger;Dhoni) 103 (174m 118b 11x4 1x6) SR: 87.28,Quinton de Kock
"Axar gets AB with an arm ball. Two wickets in two balls for India. Big, big wicket this. Arrows in, as AB goes back for a cut, he gets some bat on the attempted cut, chopping it towards point. The umpire Dar thinks it was pad first and raises his finger. Replays show that it was pad first <i>indeed</i> and hit in front of middle.",210/5,44936,40.1,lbw b Patel 4 (7m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,AB de Villiers
"Duminy holes out to long-on. Full and on middle, right in the hitting zone. Duminy goes for a loft... Raina runs in, dives forward and snaps it up. Dhawan pats Raina on the back",241/6,44932,46.4,c Raina b MM Sharma 14 (27m 14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Jean-Paul Duminy
"banged in short and hurries on, Behardien miscues a pull in front of long-on. The pair seek to hare across for the second but the throw from Raina is accurate and Steyn is run out",264/7,47492,49.5,run out (Raina/Kumar) 12 (16m 9b 0x4 1x6) SR: 133.33,Dale Steyn
