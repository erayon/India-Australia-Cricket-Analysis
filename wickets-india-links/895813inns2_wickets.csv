"gone. What a poor ball, but Rohit has to go. That is a real shame. Drifts down leg, and Rohit looks to flick but the ball kisses the glove. Wade scurries along and takes a lovely diving catch. Rohit's blitz ends.",65/1,34102,7.6,c &dagger;Wade b Richardson 41 (28m 25b 2x4 3x6) SR: 164.00,Rohit Sharma
the misfield seems to have done Australia a favour. Can that change things? Or is too little too late? Dhawan goes. End of a scintillating knock from Dhawan. A smashing 126. A slower delivery outside off and Dhawan goes for the cut but cannot keep it down as backward point takes it.,277/2,28235,37.3,c Bailey b Hastings 126 (154m 113b 14x4 2x6) SR: 111.50,Shikhar Dhawan
"Dhoni goes now. The crowd goes wild. Legcutter outside off, Dhoni comes down to try and manufacture a shot. He pokes at it and gets a thin outside edge which is gratefully accepted by Wade. Australia not out of it, just yet.",277/3,28081,37.6,c &dagger;Wade b Hastings 0 (2m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,MS Dhoni
"Kohli finds the fielder. What is happening here? A nothing delivery from Richardson, fullish on leg. Kohli comes down the track and lobs a catch to mid-off. Just spooned up. Looked like a checked drive. Big big wicket. But, that has been a truly special innings from Kohli.",278/4,253802,39.1,c Smith b Richardson 106 (131m 92b 11x4 1x6) SR: 115.21,Virat Kohli
"taken by Shaun marsh. Gurkeerat persishes now. Flat on middle and leg, Gurkeerat goes for the big sweep but gets a top edge which goes very high in the air. Marsh circles around from square leg and takes a catch overhead. Pressure catch. Australia are right in it",286/5,537124,40.2,c sub (SE Marsh) b Lyon 5 (9m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Gurkeerat Singh Mann
"did that carry? Smith claims it. The slip fielder takes it. Smith put himself in there and takes a very good low catch. Full delivery outside off, Rahane tries to guide to third man but gets a thick outside edge. Smith takes it. Massive wicket. India are six down now.",294/6,277916,41.5,c Smith b Richardson 2 (7m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Ajinkya Rahane
"Dhawan has to go now, he has holed out to the sweeper cover. Full delivery, cross seam from Richardson outside off.

taken now. Bhuvneshwar carves this with tentative hands and tentative feet to first slip. Smith makes no mistake.  A shortish delivery that outside off. Richardson has a five-for. What an astounding turnaround this.,311/8,326016,45.3,c Smith b Richardson 2 (6m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Bhuvneshwar Kumar
"this time, Bailey intervenes and takes it. Fuller length on off, Yadav is not changing his technique, another wild slog. the ball goes up again, but nowhere near enough distance. Bailey, from point, has a look at Smith and then settles under it to pouch it.",315/9,376116,47.4,c Bailey b Marsh 2 (11m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 18.18,Umesh Yadav
"and that will be the game. Marsh takes the final wicket. <strong>18 in succession at home for Australia</strong>. Full delivery outside off, a thick outside edge is easily taken by Wade. Australia go 4-0 up.",323/10,236779,49.2,c &dagger;Wade b Marsh 0 (8m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Ishant Sharma
