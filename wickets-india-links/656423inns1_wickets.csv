"Oh, my. That's an unfortunate way to go. Dhawan comes on the front foot to push into the covers, where Duminy makes a super diving stop, and the ball rolls to AB at mid-off. Rohit had sprinted out of his crease, and was quite a distance down it when he realised the ball hadn't gone past the fielder. Stumbled as he turned. AB hits the stumps direct, and Rohit is well short, even while diving, and the bat's slipped out of his hand as well.",9/1,34102,2.5,run out (de Villiers) 0 (13m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Rohit Sharma
"Tahir strikes with a long-hop! Kohli rocks back to pull, hits it straight to Faf at short midwicket, at chest height. He was sent spinning by the power of the shot, but clung on safely enough",136/2,253802,27.1,c du Plessis b Imran Tahir 46 (106m 60b 3x4 0x6) SR: 76.66,Virat Kohli
"got him. That was banged in short, and he had to fetch the pull from over his left shoulder. Hit high on the bat and looped up and down into the hands of the fielder at long leg. End of a superb innings from Dhawan, he's really turned his form around here.",261/3,28235,43.4,c Amla b Parnell 137 (199m 146b 16x4 2x6) SR: 93.83,Shikhar Dhawan
"and now he takes one. Far simpler catch. Morkel banged it in again and Raina cleared his front leg and pulled it in the air once more, this time it's straight at the fielder, at chest height",269/4,33335,44.5,c sub (RR Rossouw) b Morkel 6 (6m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 120.00,Suresh Raina
"got him. Walked across and looked to club it away to the leg side. It was a touch too full, maybe, and it came in off the seam and hit him on the back thigh. Given immediately, and Rahane didn't review",278/5,277916,45.6,lbw b Steyn 79 (90m 60b 7x4 3x6) SR: 131.66,Ajinkya Rahane
"Direct hit. Boom. Full and wide again and this time he drives to mid-off and sets off for the single, AB hits the stumps at the bowler's end and Jadeja wasn't even close to making it",284/6,234675,47.2,run out (de Villiers) 2 (4m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Ravindra Jadeja
"got him! Morkel bangs it in halfway and Dhoni shuffles across to hook, only manages a top-edge through to the keeper",302/7,28081,48.5,c &dagger;de Kock b Morkel 18 (22m 11b 3x4 0x6) SR: 163.63,MS Dhoni
