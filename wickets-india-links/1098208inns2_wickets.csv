"bowled him, that's an absolute beauty. Hits just the right length, swings back in, and hits off stump as Lewis, jumping back and across and still on the move, jabs hurriedly, bat coming down from gully and creating a gap for the ball to sneak through. That was quick, close to 142kph, and Lewis was late on the ball. Kept slightly low too, but he should have been going forward, considering the length",9/1,431901,1.2, b Yadav 2 (m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Evin Lewis
"this time he does go for the hook, taking it from over his right shoulder, and only manages a top-edge that drops into the hands of deep square leg, who walks a few yards in from the rope and takes it comfortably",54/2,443150,12.4,c Jadhav b Pandya 19 (m 35b 3x4 0x6) SR: 54.28,Kyle Hope
"oh my, that was just brilliant. Not the greatest shot from Chase, though. It's a shot he takes on even against the legspinners, trusting his reach to be able to whip balls against the turn through midwicket, but here it went all wrong - firstly, I don't think he picked the googly, and that meant he was playing down the wrong line and off balance. The ball spun past his shot and hit off stump. Did I mention playing down the wrong line - it's also because it drifted a long way from outside leg and pitched just about on leg stump",58/3,391832,13.4, b Kuldeep Yadav 2 (m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Roston Chase
"<b>near-perfect bouncer</b> and that's the end of Shai Hope. He's angry with himself. It was an ordinary shot, but a very well-directed short one from Hardik. Shai was late on the hook as he tried to pick it from in front of his right shoulder. Top-edge onto helmet and an easy lobbed catch for Hardik",69/4,581379,16.4,c &amp; b Pandya 24 (m 50b 2x4 0x6) SR: 48.00,Shai Hope
"a stumping appeal down the leg side. It's a wide, Holder was down and he looks very out. It's been referred. Yes, the foot wasn't down. It was a poor delivery, short and spinning down leg. Dhoni gathers, whips the bails off, and then appeals for a caught behind too - the straight umpire only signals wide. Hardik Pandya at square leg has a big smile when the leg umpire makes the signal for a replay",87/5,391485,19.4,st &dagger;Dhoni b Ashwin 6 (m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Jason Holder
"<b>holes out.</b> The pressure was built, the time was ripe for a wrong'un, and pop it came. Good length, turning away from off stump, and climbing too steeply for that slog sweep. Hardik calls from long leg and deep midwicket allows him to get under it and pouch it comfortably",141/6,820351,32.4,c Pandya b Kuldeep Yadav 30 (m 43b 5x4 0x6) SR: 69.76,Rovman Powell
"<b>Umesh dives and holds on to his left.</b> That's a very very good catch. This is tossed up at middle stump and it dips at Nurse, who is only worried about sending this flying over the midwicket boundary. He can't reach the ball and gets it off the inside half of a turning bat. Umesh leaps to his left at square leg to hold on to this",148/7,315594,33.6,c Yadav b Ashwin 6 (m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Ashley Nurse
"oh no. Mohammed was looking good, and now he's out to a poor choice of shot. Looks to sweep from the stumps, and goes after one that's too full. It hits his front foot almost on the full. Yorked the boot. He's called for a review, but this just looked plumb on first viewing... No inside-edge. Pitches on middle, straightening to hit low on middle, and it's even plumber after ball-tracking has its say",156/8,230549,36.5,lbw b Kuldeep Yadav 40 (m 61b 4x4 0x6) SR: 65.57,Jason Mohammed
"gone, that's Ashwin's 150th in ODIs. An excellent delivery to bring up the milestone. Cummins was playing everything off the back foot, and Ashwin bowled that arm ball again. It was too full to be playing back to, and by the time the bat came down in defence, it had slid through and struck his back pad in front of middle stump",157/9,556749,37.3,lbw b Ashwin 1 (m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Miguel Cummins
"the man has a golden arm, and he strikes first ball to finish off this match. Nicely bowled, a bit of drift away from the right-hander, who plays inside the line while defending. Beats the outside edge but spins back just enough to hit off stump",158/10,450075,38.1, b Jadhav 1 (m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Kesrick Williams
