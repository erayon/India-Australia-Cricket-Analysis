"Rohit Sharma gone early at the MCG, after opening 2016 with back-to-back tons! Full and in the corridor outside off, Rohit looked to run it down to third man. Richardson finds the outside edge and Wade snaffles it. Rohit was late to swish his bat away earlier. This time, he has nicked behind for 6",15/1,34102,4.3,c &dagger;Wade b Richardson 6 (17m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 54.54,Rohit Sharma
Hastings bowls Dhawan and lets out a roar! Full and Dhawan shuffles across off. He wants to pick it up and lift it away over square leg. No dice. Hastings nails the leg stump. Hastings has reward for hitting the deck hard and tying down India,134/2,28235,26.5, b Hastings 68 (108m 91b 9x4 0x6) SR: 74.72,Shikhar Dhawan
"#MCG is so big, Rahane can't clear the fielder. He jumps out, Hastings bangs it short. Rahane drags a pull, Smith runs to his right from long-on, catches it at the edge of the boundary. He loses his balance but tosses the ball over to the man running from deep midwicket (Maxi). We saw a similar catch in the Big Bash Sydney derby yesterday. Silk and Botha were at the tag-team work yesterday",243/3,277916,44.2,c Maxwell b Hastings 50 (72m 55b 4x4 1x6) SR: 90.90,Ajinkya Rahane
"Kohli steps out and hits it straight into the lap of extra cover. Hastings rolls his fingers across this slower one outside off, 120ks, Kohli slaps it to Bailey. Looked like a leg-breakish slower one. Kohli, who can't manufacture his own pace, is out for a run-a-ball 117",265/4,253802,46.2,c Bailey b Hastings 117 (174m 117b 7x4 2x6) SR: 100.00,Virat Kohli
"Gurkeerat undone by the slower ball. This is a Faulkner special, comes from the back of the hand, Gurkeerat does not spot it. He is early into the slog and drags it back onto the leg stump off a thick inside edge. Two slower balls. Two wickets in two overs",274/5,537124,47.4, b Faulkner 8 (6m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 114.28,Gurkeerat Singh Mann
"four, six, and out! Dhoni spanks it, Maxi takes it, he feels the heat. Wrings his hands. Dhoni danced out again, Hastings banged it onto the middle of the pitch at 140ks. Pulled to deep midwicket, where Maxi hangs onto the catch",288/6,28081,48.5,c Maxwell b Hastings 23 (23m 9b 2x4 2x6) SR: 255.55,MS Dhoni
