"an early breakthrough for India! Bumrah removes Hales, short of a length ball that cuts away just a touch, Hales is drawn towards it and he feathers it through for a simple catch to Dhoni",28/1,249866,3.5,c &dagger;Dhoni b Bumrah 14 (16m 12b 3x4 0x6) SR: 116.66,Alex Hales
"Ashwin breaks the century stand in his first over. Tossed-up offbreak, does not turn much but dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch. Root goes low for a slog-sweep, probably bounced higher. He does not get hold of it. Only skies it in the air off a top edge. Kohli runs in and settles under it at midwicket",128/2,303669,19.5,c Kohli b Ashwin 54 (65m 55b 8x4 0x6) SR: 98.18,Joe Root
"Jadeja leaves Roy's stumps in a mess. Slides in with the arm, and straightens. Roy aims to chop or dab it from the stumps towards third man. He can't lay bat on ball, and Jadeja strikes. Spinners setting England back",170/3,298438,26.1, b Jadeja 82 (103m 73b 9x4 2x6) SR: 112.32,Jason Roy
"Inside-edged onto the middle stump. This was the arm-ball from Ashwin slides in and keeps a touch low. Instead of meeting the ball on the front foot, Stokes plays back and drags it onto the stumps. Two wickets in eight balls",173/4,311158,27.2, b Ashwin 1 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Ben Stokes
"Buttler shows his ace early and advances down the track. Ashwin is wary of it as he fires it short and quick - 93.2ks- down the leg side; leg-side wide it is. Buttler, having ventured a long way down the track, is beaten lavishly. Dhoni, the cool cat, collects it and flips the bails off although the ball got caught in the webbing",206/5,308967,31.3,st &dagger;Dhoni b Ashwin 10 (16m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 111.11,Jos Buttler
"dragged on! That's what India needed. A wicket for the stoppage? A length ball outside off, Moeen tries to swing it away and gets a bottom edge into off stump. Was a slower ball, too, so credit to Buvi. Moeen through the shot",299/6,8917,43.3, b Kumar 55 (55m 43b 6x4 0x6) SR: 127.90,Moeen Ali
"off stump goes back! Another subtle change of pace. It's a length ball at off stump, Woakes tries to heave to the leg side and is far too early on the stroke. Excellent delivery",304/7,247235,44.2, b Bumrah 5 (5m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125.00,Chris Woakes
"super bit of cricket which could seal the deal! Get his yorker in, Plunkett can only find the bowler. Morgan had already sprinted off to try and get the strike back. Bumrah calmly turned, moved towards the stumps and then threw the ball when he was closer",354/8,24598,48.3,run out (Bumrah) 102 (129m 81b 6x4 5x6) SR: 125.92,Eoin Morgan
