"taken. A thick outside edge is taken by Ronchi. Back of a length outside off, Rohit tries to force his drive through the off side but the ball may have seamed away just a tad and took the edge. Rohit immediately <b>clutches his bicep, writhing in pain</b> as the physio comes out to take a look at him. Not sure what he has done. Did try to punch the ball, immediate pain after the stroke. Boult, though, is pumped with the wicket. A reward for some very tight bowling.",21/1,34102,7.1,c &dagger;Ronchi b Boult 15 (28m 27b 1x4 1x6) SR: 55.55,Rohit Sharma
"gone. Kohli has been strangled down leg. Flat delivery down leg, Kohli flicks but gets just a thin edge which is wonderfully taken by Ronchi well down leg. Kohli has a smile on his face. Knew he hit that. Unfortunate way to go.",40/2,253802,11.4,c &dagger;Ronchi b Santner 9 (18m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 69.23,Virat Kohli
"he isn't sure. What an effort that is. Anderson gets low, and it looks like he has taken at first glance. <strong>Soft decision is out. </strong>Good change-up from Southee, a bouncer on middle. Rahane doesn't get on top of the bounce. Pulls to fine leg, where Anderson rushes in, stays low and takes the catch off the ground? Many replays. Did it land just in front of Anderson? Umpire Shamsuddin is the third umpire. He needs conclusive evidence that it has bounced to overturn this. Definitely bounced, but did it in his hands or on the turf. More and more replays. He doesn't have conclusive evidence to overturn his call. No doubt in my mind that it would have been not out had the soft decision been not out. Nonetheless, such is life, such is sport. Rahane has to walk back, India in a bit of trouble.",72/3,277916,18.4,c Anderson b Southee 28 (75m 49b 3x4 0x6) SR: 57.14,Ajinkya Rahane
"flat on middle, worked to deep square leg. Pandey looks for the second, hurtles back for it. Puts in a full-length dive. But that doesn't matter because he is more than a  few inches short. A fantastic throw from Santner, running around from a straight square leg, to the keeper. Ronchi comes in front of the stumps, collects the throw in front of him and he takes off the stumps in one motion. Was the run necessary? Pandey would have made the second against most teams. That was splendid from NZ. India in trouble now.",73/4,290630,19.2,run out (Santner/&dagger;Ronchi) 19 (34m 25b 0x4 1x6) SR: 76.00,Manish Pandey
"caught behind! Jadhav has steered the ball to the wicketkeeper. It was too full and a bit too close to him outside off to try and dab it to third man. Jadhav got down low to try and execute it, but the ball pitched just before and he couldn't control the bounce, a loopy catch for Ronchi",139/5,290716,31.1,c &dagger;Ronchi b Henry 41 (47m 37b 2x4 2x6) SR: 110.81,Kedar Jadhav
"that is a sensational catch, a little like how Shane Bond caught Cameron White in New Zealand many years ago! Dhoni pushed at the ball a bit too early and it came right back down the pitch, in the air but it was dying as it approached the bowler. Southee was moving towards his left in the follow through but he stopped and dived to his right to scoop the ball with one hand inches before it was going to bounce. So Dhoni will not take this game deep, someone else has to try and finish it for India. New Zealand edge ahead in this tense chase.",172/6,28081,39.3,c &amp; b Southee 39 (95m 65b 3x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,MS Dhoni
"would you believe it, Axar has mowed a full toss towards long-on, where Santner runs in from the boundary and dives forward to catch it inches from the turf. That was such a loose ball but Axar wasn't entirely balanced as he hit that, perhaps he tried to smash it too hard",180/7,554691,40.1,c Santner b Guptill 17 (47m 22b 0x4 1x6) SR: 77.27,Axar Patel
"Guptill has two in the over! Luck, or a masterstroke from Williamson? Mishra plonks his front foot down the pitch and mows across the line, the ball flies towards short fine leg off the top edge and Bracewell runs backwards to settle under the catch. This chase has unravelled quickly with India a long way from the target",183/8,31107,40.5,c sub (DAJ Bracewell) b Guptill 1 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Amit Mishra
"Pandya's fight has ended and silence blankets the Kotla. The short ball brings the wicket. Boult dug that in really short and Pandya met it way outside the crease, trying to slap it down the ground off the front foot and with a flat bat. He was in a really awkward position as he made contact and the top edge flew high in the air towards the fielder on the sweeper boundary. Santner judged the high-pressure catch well",232/9,625371,48.5,c Santner b Boult 36 (51m 32b 3x4 0x6) SR: 112.50,Hardik Pandya
"Southee raises his arms in relief almost after delivering the perfect yorker to the No.11, returning the favour to Bumrah. The ball swings into the right-hander and dips under the bat to crash into middle stump, lighting up the bails to give New Zealand their first victory on what has been a tough tour of India. New Zealand level the series with a six-run victory.",236/10,625383,49.3, b Southee 0 (4m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Jasprit Bumrah
