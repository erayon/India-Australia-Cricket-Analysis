"gone! That was the perfect length in the corridor, and it straightened a touch after angling in from around the wicket. Dhawan pushed at it with an angled bat, and Sammy held the edge well to his right side at second slip",11/1,28235,4.1,c Sammy b Taylor 9 (17m 14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 64.28,Shikhar Dhawan
"gone! That is a beauty from Taylor, just short of driving length outside off. Rohit went for the drive away from his body, and it swung away late and kissed his edge through to Ramdin",20/2,34102,6.6,c &dagger;Ramdin b Taylor 7 (30m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.88,Rohit Sharma
"gone! That was a better short ball on this pitch. Batsmen have struggled to pull from outside off on this pitch, and Kohli's no exception, had to meet it at shoulder height, top-edges it and he spoons it straight down the throat of the man at long leg",63/3,253802,14.6,c Samuels b Russell 33 (51m 36b 5x4 0x6) SR: 91.66,Virat Kohli
"given! Made room to dab it down to third man, and the ball slipped past (or off) his edge very quickly through to Ramdin. Rahane reviews it. Replays look inconclusive. It straightened a touch and went very close to the outside edge. The bat, as it came down, hit the flap of his back pad. Seam position remained the same as the ball passed the bat.  There's a bit of a spike on Snicko, but it's hard to say if that was ball on edge or bat on pad. In the end, the third umpire upholds the decision. Interesting one, this.",78/4,277916,17.5,c &dagger;Ramdin b Roach 14 (56m 34b 2x4 0x6) SR: 41.17,Ajinkya Rahane
"gone! Smith has struck! It isn't the greatest ball anyone has bowled today, it's short, a reasonable amount of width outside off, but Raina can only top-edge his slash through to the keeper",107/5,33335,22.5,c &dagger;Ramdin b Smith 22 (42m 25b 2x4 0x6) SR: 88.00,Suresh Raina
"another wicket off a short ball, another miscued pull. It's shoulder high outside off, that is the golden area in this match, and he top-edged it straight into the hands of Samuels at deep square leg. Nearly dropped it, but held on at the third attempt",134/6,234675,29.3,c Samuels b Russell 13 (31m 23b 2x4 0x6) SR: 56.52,Ravindra Jadeja
