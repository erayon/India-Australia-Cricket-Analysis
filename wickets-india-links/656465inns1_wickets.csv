"oh, man. That's a tame end to a promising innings. Ashwin, to his credit, held it back just a bit and beat him in the air as Stirling looked to hit over the top. Ended up checking his shot, and scooping the simplest of catches to long-off. Poor choice of shot, considering the fielder was in the deep.",89/1,303427,14.6,c Rahane b Ashwin 42 (60m 41b 4x4 2x6) SR: 102.43,Paul Stirling
"gone! That was angled in again, a bit round-arm, and was neither short enough nor wide enough to cut. Made himself room, and it hurried through him and took out his middle stump",92/2,24249,17.2, b Raina 2 (7m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22,Ed Joyce
"gone! Came down the track, and looked to chip the ball into the leg side, from outside off, against the angle. Takes the leading edge and pops in the air, easy catch for the backpedalling Umesh at mid-off",145/3,24611,31.2,c Yadav b MM Sharma 67 (106m 93b 5x4 1x6) SR: 72.04,William Porterfield
"got him. Looks for the sweep again, and that shot has been fraught with danger today. There's a bit of extra bounce and he top-edges it, loops to the left of short fine leg and Shami takes a good running catch",206/4,303423,38.6,c Mohammed Shami b Ashwin 24 (28m 24b 3x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Andy Balbirnie
"there won't be any KOB fireworks today. Lovely delivery from Shami, straightening a touch, very close to off stump. He drove hard without coming forward, and sent a thin nick through to Dhoni",208/5,24605,39.3,c &dagger;Dhoni b Mohammed Shami 1 (6m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Kevin O'Brien
"another batsman is out playing the sweep. This was angled down the leg side, but again he top-edged it, may have gone off the toe-end, in fact, and Rahane, running to his left from short fine leg, took it on the dive, nice and low",222/6,24609,41.2,c Rahane b Jadeja 6 (9m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 85.71,Gary Wilson
"he won't get it! Shami spears it full on off stump, and he took a step down the track and shuffled across to clip it through the leg side. Hit it uppishly, straight to Umesh Yadav at backward square leg",226/7,24289,42.1,c Yadav b Mohammed Shami 75 (88m 75b 7x4 3x6) SR: 100.00,Niall O'Brien
"back of a length outside off, and that is a super throw. He punched to short cover and Thompson took off for the single but Mooney sent him back. Kohli hits the stumps direct at the bowler's end, and the diving batsman is nowhere near the crease",227/8,414821,42.3,run out (Kohli) 2 (10m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Stuart Thompson
"nine down. It's a shortish ball from Umesh, outside off, and Dockrell had backed away to make room. Looked for the pull, there was a bit of extra bounce, and he sent a thick, loud edge through to Dhoni",238/9,348034,45.3,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 6 (14m 12b 0x4 1x6) SR: 50.00,George Dockrell
"and that is 50 wickets in five matches. It's short over off stump, he leaned away to ramp it and landed it straight into third man's hands",259/10,293983,48.6,c Yadav b Mohammed Shami 11 (18m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 84.61,Alex Cusack
