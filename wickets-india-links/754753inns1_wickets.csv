"first ball he has done it! Dhawan is reminded of England straightaway and it's yet another failure for him. This is beautifully bowled. It's on a length around off stump, bounces extra and just moves away a touch. Dhawan comes forward but can only edge it to the keeper",1/1,28235,2.1,c &dagger;Buttler b Anderson 1 (9m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00,Shikhar Dhawan
he has thrown it away! Poor shot from Rahane. Fifth time Rahane dismissed by Finn. He comes down the pitch and looks to whack the back of length delivery over midwicket but the extra bounce means it hits the splice of the bot and balloons towards mid-on where the fielder backpedals and takes an easy catch,57/2,277916,14.3,c Taylor b Finn 33 (60m 40b 1x4 1x6) SR: 82.50,Ajinkya Rahane
he is gone! The extra bounce has done him here. He looks to dab the back of length delivery towards third man but this rises up and catches the shoulder of the bat... It flies high and Buttler takes a good catch behind the stumps. That is an action replay of Kohli's dismissal in the first innings of the Brisbane Test,64/3,253802,16.4,c &dagger;Buttler b Finn 4 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Virat Kohli
"Moeen creates magic again! Raina steps out too early.. The bowler shortens the length, gets it to turn past the outside edge and Raina is stranded down the pitch.. He doesn't even make the effort to get back.",65/4,33335,17.2,st &dagger;Buttler b Ali 1 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Suresh Raina
"Numero tres for Finn!! This is not too different from how Kohli got out.. back of length, rising outside off, Rayudu looks to guide it to third man but gets a thick edge to the keeper. It's that extra bounce again. Indian batsmen being swallowed at the Gabbatoir",67/5,33141,18.6,c &dagger;Buttler b Finn 23 (76m 53b 2x4 0x6) SR: 43.39,Ambati Rayudu
"gets his man! Finn has four now. Dhoni couldn't add on after that chance. It's a slower bounce on the leg stump line, Dhoni goes for the hook but feathers it to the keeper",137/6,28081,36.1,c &dagger;Buttler b Finn 34 (70m 61b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.73,MS Dhoni
he has got his five-for! Excellent bowling from round the stump. This one is fuller and comes in a touch to beat the inside edge.. goes through the gap and hits the top of off. Happy birthday Axar. It's his second <i>golden</i> duck in two games,137/7,554691,36.2, b Finn 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Axar Patel
now Anderson gets his second! This is full and straight and heading towards the off stump. Bhuvi just plays down the wrong line and it hits the top of off. India unravelling fast.,143/8,326016,37.2, b Anderson 5 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Bhuvneshwar Kumar
"superb catch by El Capitano! Binny looks to chip it over mid-off but gets more height than distance.. Morgan runs back, keeps his eyes firmly on the ball and takes a tumbling catch",153/9,27223,39.2,c Morgan b Anderson 44 (84m 55b 3x4 2x6) SR: 80.00,Stuart Binny
"this has been smoked! But what a fantastic catch by Moeen at cow corner! Shami whacked it with a lot of timing.. all eyes were aimed at the stands to see where it was landing, but no one saw Moeen setting himself up near the boundary.. he keeps his calm, avoids the rope and gobbles it up",153/10,481896,39.3,c Ali b Anderson 1 (13m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28,Mohammed Shami
