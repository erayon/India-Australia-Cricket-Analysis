"Bhuvneshwar provides India with the breakthrough. Shehzad has been given out leg-before. Shehzad chats with his partner and Pakistan decide against a review. Bhuvneshwar ventures wide of the crease, on a length and angled in, Shehzad plays across the line and is rapped on the front pad in front of off. The tracker returns three reds. Kohli roars and gives Shehzad a send-off",47/1,259410,8.6,lbw b Kumar 12 (38m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 54.54,Ahmed Shehzad
"short and wide outside off - much like the previous ball - Babar slashes in the air again, this time Jadeja moves to his right from backward point and tracks it down",61/2,348144,12.2,c Jadeja b Yadav 8 (15m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Babar Azam
"goes for the sweep again, it's a touch shorter, though, and the bounce means he gets a top-edge. Easy catch at deep square leg, Hardik moves a few steps to his right and takes it with both hands, cupped at around shoulder height",91/3,39037,20.5,c Pandya b Jadeja 50 (85m 65b 6x4 0x6) SR: 76.92,Azhar Ali
"Ravindra Jadeja. What a left arm. Umesh sends down a length ball angling in towards top of off. Cramps Malik slightly, and he dabs it to the left of backward point and sets off for a single. He shouldn't have, because it was Jadeja moving quickly to the ball, towards his natural side. By the time he's realised and turned around, he's already out, caught out by a deadly, flat rocket of a direct hit",114/4,42657,23.3,run out (Jadeja) 15 (14m 9b 2x4 1x6) SR: 166.66,Shoaib Malik
"gone, Hafeez's rather tortured stay ends. Goes for the sweep from just outside off, makes decent contact but only picks out Bhuvneshwar running to his left rom deep square leg",131/5,41434,26.3,c Kumar b Jadeja 33 (59m 43b 2x4 0x6) SR: 76.74,Mohammad Hafeez
"length ball slanting away from off stump, and Imad Wasim is out first ball. No footwork, just flays at it, middles it but hits it uppishly and straight to Jadhav at cover point. Went straight to him, but hard, and he took it well, getting down low and holding it with two hands over his head",135/6,227758,27.3,c Jadhav b Pandya 0 (5m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Imad Wasim
"oh my, keeper nicks to keeper. Almost guides it to the keeper. Looks for the open-faced dab to third man, but this back-of-a-length ball didn't offer him enough width, and bounced a touch extra to catch the outside third of the bat",151/7,227760,29.3,c &dagger;Dhoni b Pandya 15 (26m 16b 2x4 0x6) SR: 93.75,Sarfraz Ahmed
"and another. Umesh gets his second. Back of a length, slanting across to off stump. Clears his front leg and looks to hit over cover, ends up hitting it flat, at catchable height",164/8,290948,33.2,c Jadhav b Yadav 9 (16m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 56.25,Mohammad Amir
"shortish, angled into the body, and that is that. Wahab Riaz is not going to bat here. Cramped for room, beaten for pace, and he aims an aimless flick at the ball and loops the simplest of catches to Dhawan at midwicket",164/10,681305,33.4,c Dhawan b Yadav 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Hasan Ali
