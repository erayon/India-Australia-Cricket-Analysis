"Willey gets his man. The swing does it even though this is not a regulation swing dismissal. Dhawan goes hard for a cover drive, but the ball swings and takes a thick edge of the bat to carry all the way to third man. Moeen takes it on the third go as it threatens to slip out of the hands",13/1,28235,3.6,c Ali b Willey 1 (18m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10.00,Shikhar Dhawan
"the crowd is stunned. Willey spears this in really full. It swings in late, beats the shot on the inside and flattens the middle stump",24/2,422108,5.5, b Willey 8 (28m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 44.44,Lokesh Rahul
"finally Nandan gets one right but this is such a bonus for England. This ball doesn't deserve a wicket. A gentle length ball pitched outside leg. Yuvraj moves a touch too far inside, and gets a tickle through to the keeper. What a big bonus for England here. Yuvraj looked in good touch. Okay, on second thoughts, is it the threat of the short ball that had him moving back and across too far? The more I think about it, I think it is the threat of the short ball in Yuvraj's mind that has resulted in this wicket",56/3,36084,10.2,c &dagger;Buttler b Stokes 15 (21m 12b 2x4 1x6) SR: 125.00,Yuvraj Singh
"and Ball gets him with the ball short of a length and that cramps him up. Dhoni premeditates, walks down the wicket, has nowhere to go as Ball pitches short, and the top edge lobs up for a catch at midwicket. There is a morgue-like silence at the ground",63/4,28081,11.5,c Willey b Ball 6 (7m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,MS Dhoni
"oh Kohli for once has failed to finish off a chase. It's that man Stokes again, but is it too late? Kohli has played a modern classic here. Slower short ball, he looks to pull from outside off, and gets a top edge. Kohli knows he has made a mistake and his head falls away right away. Willey takes the catch at cover, and the crowd stands up for a great innings. Kohli acknowledges the crowd's response but he is bitterly disappointed he is not there when the winning runs are hit",263/5,253802,36.2,c Willey b Stokes 122 (147m 105b 8x4 5x6) SR: 116.19,Virat Kohli
you can hear a pin drop in the stands. Jadhav has pulled one straight to deep square leg. England receive the boost but Jadhav is not worried about showing emotion. He calls Pandya through for a chat. And the crowd doesn't react nearly as generously as it did to Kohli when he was walking off. This has been a great innings. Just a shame about the cramps. England stay alive here,291/6,290716,39.5,c Stokes b Ball 120 (125m 76b 12x4 4x6) SR: 157.89,Kedar Jadhav
Jadeja has thrown it away. He is a better batsman than this. He can score a run a ball. He clears the front leg and pulls from wide outside off. Toe-ends this to mid-on. India leave the door open,318/7,234675,44.1,c Rashid b Ball 13 (24m 15b 2x4 0x6) SR: 86.66,Ravindra Jadeja
