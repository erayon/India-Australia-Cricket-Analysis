"taken this time! Pressure has built and built into a wicket. And both fielders responsible for the first two dropped chances combine to remove Dhawan. Good length again outside off, Dhawan advances and tries to drive through the off side but the ball may have moved away again just enough. Thick outside edge and well taken by AB diving to his left.",41/1,28235,10.4,c &dagger;de Villiers b Morkel 13 (45m 29b 2x4 0x6) SR: 44.82,Shikhar Dhawan
Rohit falls! Excellent improvisation there from JP. Sees Rohit coming down and bowls that a touch shorter. Rohit is left feeling for that and can only pat the ball back to JP who dives low and holds on to a good catch. He is pumped too.,113/2,34102,23.1,c &amp; b Duminy 65 (95m 74b 7x4 2x6) SR: 87.83,Rohit Sharma
"gone! What a wicket, huge huge stuff. Short ball outside off, Dhoni looks to dab that over short third man but the ball lobs up to Steyn at short third man. takes an easy catch and this match gets interesting",193/3,28081,41.5,c Steyn b Morkel 47 (85m 61b 5x4 0x6) SR: 77.04,MS Dhoni
"taken! Not a great shot from Raine with Kohli going strong from the other end. Googly outside off, Raina looks to drive over the man at long-off but doesn't get all of it. Lands down Miller's throat at long-off. A single would have been a good result but he wanted more. One crucial moment lost by Raina and India",206/4,33335,43.3,c Miller b Imran Tahir 0 (11m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Suresh Raina
"Morkel wins this moment. What a wicket this is. Is this the defining moment? Short on leg and Kohli can only heave the ball in the air to Miller at deep midwicket who takes a comfortable catch. This line, length and field placement has worked wonders so far. Stalled Kohli throughout the second part of his innings. Take a bow, Russell Domingo and AB de Villiers",216/5,253802,45.1,c Miller b Morkel 77 (155m 99b 5x4 0x6) SR: 77.77,Virat Kohli
"repeat delivery. Repeat shot. Repeat dismissal. Miller takes this low to the ground, that being the only difference. Banged in short again, Rahane advances and slogs this in the air to deep midwicket. Are these percentage shots? With this consistent length, the batsmen have been found out playing poor shots.",216/6,277916,45.2,c Miller b Morkel 4 (12m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14,Ajinkya Rahane
