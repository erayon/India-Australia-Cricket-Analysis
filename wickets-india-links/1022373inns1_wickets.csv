"bowled him! Not the greatest shot from Sarkar there. Length ball, angling away wide of off stump, and his front foot goes nowhere as he reaches out to drive. Plays with an angled bat, and can only chop it onto his stumps",1/1,436677,0.6, b Kumar 0 (5m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Soumya Sarkar
"got him! Another slower ball, this one's shorter and much wider than the previous one. It took ages getting to Sabbir, begging him to go after it. He does, but in an effort to manufacture some power, fails to keep his cut down, and hits it straight to backward point",31/2,373538,6.5,c Jadeja b Kumar 19 (24m 21b 4x4 0x6) SR: 90.47,Sabbir Rahman
"and Jadhav strikes. All those dots and Tamim is forced into a big shot. Straight and accurate from Jadhav, the length isn't full or short. But Tamim wants to hit through midwicket. He misses his slog sweep and the ball goes onto hit leg stump. Done in by pressure and Jadhav's length, not the right option, a cross-batted stroke to that ball",154/3,56194,27.6, b Jadhav 70 (105m 82b 7x4 1x6) SR: 85.36,Tamim Iqbal
"and the pressure is released in the form of another wicket. Short and wide outside off, the ball turns in. Too close to cut, Shakib goes back and tries to hit the gap in front of point but Jadeja's flat trajectory and angle (the ball spinning in) means it's not a high percentage stroke. The ball skids on with the arm and takes a thick edge. Quite a big deflection. But Dhoni's gloves are again in the right place and he nonchalantly makes an awfully tough catch look ridiculously simple. Toe end of the bat",177/4,56143,34.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Jadeja 15 (18m 23b 1x4 0x6) SR: 65.21,Shakib Al Hasan
"another one and Bangladesh are collapsing. So many dot balls, so much pressure. I'll release it all in one ball, says Mushfiqur to himself under his breath. So Mushfiqur thinks he can come down and swing. Jadhav tosses this up outside off, the ball dips late. Mushfiqur is too close to the ball, so decides to whip through midwicket, but it doesn't pitch. So he clips a full toss straight to midwicket, where Kohli won't drop them.",179/5,56029,35.2,c Kohli b Jadhav 61 (98m 85b 4x4 0x6) SR: 71.76,Mushfiqur Rahim
"six down. That's excellent bowling from Bumrah. Hit the deck hard again, but this time he angled it into the batsman's body. Mosaddek looked to pull, but he was cramped for room and could only offer a return catch looped back off the high part of the bat, near the sticker",218/6,550133,42.3,c &amp; b Bumrah 15 (28m 26b 3x4 0x6) SR: 57.69,Mosaddek Hossain
"gone, that's deadly. Saw Mahmudullah stepping out and trying to make some room, and speared in the perfect yorker that sneaked under his bat and took out off stump",229/7,56025,44.6, b Bumrah 21 (44m 25b 2x4 0x6) SR: 84.00,Mahmudullah
