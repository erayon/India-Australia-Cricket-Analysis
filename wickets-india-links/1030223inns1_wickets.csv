"pins him in front of middle! It's an issue that has long plagued Guptill. His front leg doesn't come down the pitch, it goes across instead. So when the ball is pitched up on off stump - like this one - and gets just enough inward movement - like this one - he's in trouble. The bat has to come around the pad. It's not quick enough.",46/1,226492,6.4,lbw b Yadav 27 (31m 21b 2x4 2x6) SR: 128.57,Martin Guptill
"that goes straight and Williamson has played all across it! Went to sweep - which is dangerous by itself when a ball is in line with the stumps - but this one was so slow. The batsman was through the shot too early and as such was a sitting duck. Jadhav must have magic fingers... well, he used only the forefinger to work on that ball to make sure it didn't turn. New Zealand's best batsman falls to India's most part-time of part-timers",80/2,277906,12.6,lbw b Jadhav 22 (27m 27b 3x4 0x6) SR: 81.48,Kane Williamson
"absolute beauty! It was slow. It was tossed up. It was drifting in. And it dips too. Poor Taylor, he was suckered into coming forward, suckered into flicking agains the turn, which dances past the leading edge, through to Dhoni who completes the stumping. Dream delivery for a legspinner",153/3,38699,28.3,st &dagger;Dhoni b Mishra 44 (56m 57b 4x4 1x6) SR: 77.19,Ross Taylor
"he's getting wickets off full tosses! Anderson looks to lash it over cover, but the connection is made a little too high on that and the ball deflects to mid-off. Rahane has to move to his left a bit and takes the catch at chest high",160/4,277662,29.4,c Rahane b Jadhav 6 (4m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 120.00,Corey Anderson
"looks like Mishra has another stumping! Dhoni is very certain of it. The loopy legspinner. It's a damn fine sight in cricket. Seduces Ronchi to drive at it, and in his haste, he's dragged his back foot out of the crease. Then it turns, oh so beautifully past the outside edge and straight into the wicketkeeper's waiting hands. Dhoni is so good with these things. Has his hands right by the stumps, not behind them like some others, and has a lot less distance to cover",161/5,7502,30.2,st &dagger;Dhoni b Mishra 1 (3m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Luke Ronchi
"picks out short cover with laser guided precision! Latham's cover drive, for once, fails. It was tossed up wide so he was within his right to go for the shot. But he should have kept it down with fielders up in the circle",169/6,388802,31.5,c Pandya b Jadhav 61 (131m 72b 3x4 1x6) SR: 84.72,Tom Latham
"held on the pitch, produced the leading edge and point takes the catch gleefully. It was back of a length. It was on the pads. The flick shot wasn't the worst one, but he is trumped by the ball coming at him a lot slower than he expected. Kohli, the catcher, sticks his tongue out in celebration. Santner, the departing batsman, jams his bat into the turf. Sums up the theme of the match",180/7,502714,34.2,c Kohli b Bumrah 7 (13m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 53.84,Mitchell Santner
"drags it on! India keep changing bowlers, and they keep getting wickets in the first over. This was a short ball, Southee went for the pull but was into the shot too early. Inside edge clatters back onto the stumps",199/8,232364,37.5, b Yadav 13 (15m 12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 108.33,Tim Southee
"that is not at all timed. It's a full toss, but Neesham seems to have got under it too much while trying to smash it down the ground. Skews away to cover, where Jadhav takes a fine catch under pressure. Thats the end of a record partnership for New Zealand for the 9th wicket - 84 in 67 balls",283/9,355269,48.6,c Jadhav b Yadav 57 (84m 47b 7x4 0x6) SR: 121.27,James Neesham
"backs away to flay the ball through cover, and he would have had it not been for Bumrah trumping him with some very clever change of pace. Flashes a big smile after felling the off stump",285/10,277912,49.4, b Bumrah 1 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Trent Boult
