"and a wicket. Ashwin strikes. Flat and wide outside off, the ball skids on and Amla is slightly late in his cut. Gets a thick edge and a pretty significant deflection. Dhoni stands his ground, gets his gloves in an excellent position and takes a lovely catch. Quickened up off the surface there. Decent knock from Amla, set a strong platform for SA",76/1,43906,17.3,c &dagger;Dhoni b Ashwin 35 (69m 54b 3x4 1x6) SR: 64.81,Hashim Amla
"there's the breakthrough from Jadeja! De Kock went for the orthodox this time for a ball that was quicker and well outside off, it turned it a little, went under de Kock's bat and found the off stump",116/2,379143,24.2, b Jadeja 53 (97m 72b 4x4 0x6) SR: 73.61,Quinton de Kock
"AB might be run-out here! Yep. Hardik's throw comes on time and Dhoni does the rest. South Africa's Superman put in the dive, looking very much like his nickname, but he wasn't quick enough this time. Not really a single there, but he responds to du Plessis looking up after patting the ball towards point. Hardik swoops in and sends a rocket throw right beside the stumps",140/3,44936,28.2,run out (Pandya/&dagger;Dhoni) 16 (16m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33,AB de Villiers
"and someone's gone! <b>Both batsmen at the same end</b>, and the third umpire has to come in to adjudicate which one of them is out. Early signs are that Miller should be run-out. What a waste. South Africa bottling things up after withstanding to pressure so well. So how did this mess happen? Well, it begins with a quicker delivery that doesn't turn. And because of that du Plessis making room to cut gets an outside edge to short third man. He sets off, then hesitates, then sets off again, and du Plessis going a second time gives Miller the go ahead to run as hard as he needs to. Only problem is by that time du Plessis again changes his mind and dives back into his batting crease, before Miller makes it. The throw, such a poor one aimed at the batsman's end, fortuitously ends up at the bowlers. Kohli collects it and breaks the stumps to seal the absolute mess.",142/4,321777,29.1,run out (Bumrah/Kohli) 1 (5m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,David Miller
"beautiful bowling! No more can you say Hardik's a blind hit-the-deck-get-flogged bowler. Out comes the slower ball, understanding that South Africa, at this point, only dare to use the pace of the bowler, and not set the pace themselves. So he sneaks in the slower ball. The offcutter, on and around off stump. It completely deceives the batsman. Du Plessis, who has been hanging on the back foot, has to come forward, but his balance is off. He throws his hands at the ball, gets an inside edge and hears that ungodly rattle behind him",157/5,44828,33.3, b Pandya 36 (63m 50b 1x4 0x6) SR: 72.00,Faf du Plessis
"top edge and it's taken by square leg. South Africa continue to self-destruct. Who's let Dee Dee near the red button?! (Sorry to those who've never watched Dexter's Lab). Right, onto describing things. It's a short ball, on off stump, Morris takes it on with a big heave. But he has no room to play the pull and the lesson of what happens to a batsman when he plays that shot regardless will be etched into his mind forever",167/6,439952,36.4,c Kumar b Bumrah 4 (14m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Chris Morris
"whew, that's mighty close. And Kohli asks Dhoni, then Bumrah, <b>then chooses to review.</b> All this needs to do is hit Phehlukwayo in line. It was a low full toss, straight, and definitely hitting the stumps. Phehlukwayo misses the full toss and is truck in line, the ball goes on to hit the stumps and SA slump further. He has missed a straight full toss. Umpire Reiffel somehow missed that one",178/7,540316,40.1,lbw b Bumrah 4 (16m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 36.36,Andile Phehlukwayo
"edged and taken. Rabada goes. Bhuvneshwar strikes. Impeccable line and length from Bhuvneshwar. Hits a good length, pitches on middle, seams away late. Takes the outside edge and Dhoni dives forward to complete the catch. Just enough lateral movement. More would have beat the edge, less would have hit the middle.",184/8,550215,42.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Kumar 5 (11m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.50,Kagiso Rabada
one more. It's all falling apart for South Africa. Great length this. Back of a length on the fourth-stump channel. The No. 10 batsman looks to drive with his bat well away from the body. Gets a thick outside edge and carries to a wide slip where Kohli takes a good catch to his left. Two in two.,184/9,46538,42.3,c Kohli b Kumar 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Morne Morkel
"swung away. What is happening. Is that another run-out? There was a misfield. Tahir is run-out by a distance and South Africa are all out. Back of a length on leg, pulled to deep midwicket. Duminy wants two, but Tahir sends him back. After the misfield though, Tahir calls him through. But by then, the throw is already in and Duminy won't be able to make it. So he sends Tahir back, who dives but Dhoni takes the bails off in time.",191/10,40618,44.3,run out (Kohli/&dagger;Dhoni) 1 (10m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28,Imran Tahir
