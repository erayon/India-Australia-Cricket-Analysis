"taken this time. The pressure was building on NZ. Latham tries to drag his sweep from well outside off and ends up getting a leading edge which lobs up for short fine leg to take. Axar slowed that up and pushed that wide, Latham ended up being too far outside off to control that stroke. Reward for some tight bowling",96/1,388802,15.3,c Rahane b Patel 39 (65m 40b 4x4 0x6) SR: 97.50,Tom Latham
"and the bowling change from spin to pace on a pitch that is assisting turn works. This is short of a length, just outside off, Guptill looks to punch it on the up but is cramped on slightly and ends up playing inside its line. The outside edge is pouched comfortably by Dhoni. A very good innings on a difficult pitch to score runs on",138/2,226492,25.1,c &dagger;Dhoni b Pandya 72 (103m 84b 12x4 0x6) SR: 85.71,Martin Guptill
"gone, caught behind. Quite a big edge. Shorter and wide outside off, Williamson fails to get over the bounce, gets an edge on his cut. Undone by a bit of an extra bounce, good length from Mishra. A false shot from Williamson or just beaten by the bounce, he throws his head back in disgust",184/3,277906,35.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Mishra 41 (81m 59b 4x4 0x6) SR: 69.49,Kane Williamson
"taken. Neesham slaps a ball to cover and falls. NZ stumbling again through the middle overs. Flatter trajectory outside off, Neesham is hesitant whether to go back or come forward. Eventually, he is in a terrible place to play the half-drive, half-cut. Excellent length. Ends up mis-timing his stroke to Kohli at cover, who dives low to his left to complete the catch. May have done some damage to his hand too. The ball may have hit Neesham twice on the bat, once at the top, then at the bottom during his swing",192/4,355269,37.6,c Kohli b Mishra 6 (9m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,James Neesham
"swung away but straight down to fine leg, and Watling goes. Fuller length down leg, Watling goes for a swing with the angle, but cannot keep it down. Cannot get enough on it. Ends up helping it down to fine leg, who had to move a few metres to his left to complete the catch.",217/5,38924,44.3,c Sharma b Kulkarni 14 (24m 21b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,BJ Watling
"swung away down to fine leg. Has Dhoni made the run-out again? Has he created something? Taylor was labouring back for the second, and pays the price as Dhoni collects the ball in front of the stumps and then deflects the ball back onto the stumps, all in one swift motion. Didn't even need to look at the stumps as he under-armed it back. A fantastic piece of agility, but not something new. If he was standing close to the stumps, Taylor would have made it with relative ease. Dhawal's throw from fine leg wasn't great - slow on the bounce, but Dhoni created the pace by getting to the ball",223/6,38699,45.3,run out (Kulkarni/&dagger;Dhoni) 35 (85m 58b 1x4 0x6) SR: 60.34,Ross Taylor
"straight to cover. Another one goes. A slower ball on leg, Devcich backs away and looks to go over cover. The right option, but bad execution. The ball hardly comes on as he ends up chipping a catch to cover who takes an easy reverse-cupped catch by his shoulder",242/7,36948,47.6,c Pandya b Yadav 11 (18m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Anton Devcich
