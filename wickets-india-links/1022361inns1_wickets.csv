"ah, the irony! He gets a lot more bat on this. Actually surprisingly good connection, with the shot being somewhere between a pull and a flick. The problem though is, with the better contact, the short ball goes squarer and finds the man on the boundary at long leg. Sri Lanka sigh in relief. India groan, ""oh, 200 denied""",138/1,34102,24.5,c NLTC Perera b Malinga 78 (107m 79b 6x4 3x6) SR: 98.73,Rohit Sharma
"he's got him! Pradeep, you beauty, baiting Kohli outside off, and nabbing him <i>easily</i>. The shot is risky, with a slip in, but the batsman goes for the glide to third man anyway. A touch of seam movement away, but more importantly a little extra bounce, undoes him.",139/2,253802,25.5,c &dagger;Dickwella b Pradeep 0 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Virat Kohli
"bowled. Chopped on. Unfortunate. But that's how it goes. A yorker outside off, Yuvraj gets his high back lift down just in time to jam that yorker out. But with the momentum of Yuvraj not having got to the ball in time, the ball goes backwards. Just clips the top of off and middle. Yuvraj is distraught and SL strike. Crucial wicket. Will stop the attack for now",179/3,36084,33.3, b Gunaratne 7 (33m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 38.88,Yuvraj Singh
"taken. End of Dhawan's quality for now. A slow, wide delivery outside off. Dhawan wants to hit the short leg side boundary but it's far too wide outside off to do that. He gets enough behind it but not great timing and his weary body lets him down. Goes straight down long-on's throat. Superb innings from Dhawan, he'll agree it's right up there. These weren't easy conditions and he hardly played a false shot.",261/4,28235,44.1,c Mendis b Malinga 125 (198m 128b 15x4 1x6) SR: 97.65,Shikhar Dhawan
gone! That's the longer boundary. Full and wide from Lakmal. Well bowled. Bowling to his field. Pandya wanted to go more over cover and the ball skews off the outside half and lobs towards the sweeper cover who comes in and completes a routine catch. Good comeback by Lakmal after the previous ball,278/5,625371,45.4,c MDKJ Perera b Lakmal 9 (8m 5b 0x4 1x6) SR: 180.00,Hardik Pandya
"taken on the boundary. Full and wide again from Perera, slightly predictable, but it isn't quite in Dhoni's swinging arc. He has to manufacture his own power and does, but doesn't get good timing. Skews off the outside half and lands in long-off's hands. Important runs saved these could be",307/6,28081,49.2,c Chandimal b NLTC Perera 63 (78m 52b 7x4 2x6) SR: 121.15,MS Dhoni
