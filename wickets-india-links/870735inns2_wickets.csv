"Tucker has given him. Tamim is waiting. They are checking it for a no-ball. The pictures are not clear but he might have a bit behind the crease. The lbw call is just as close. I would go ahead and risk it by saying this would have missed the leg stump. This is bowled from round the stumps, short of a length, and seams back in to go with the angle to hit him in front of middle. Also on the knee roll so height could have been an issue too. The umpire thinks it isn't going too far, I think it is",8/1,56194,1.6,lbw b Kulkarni 5 (9m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.50,Tamim Iqbal
"slower ball does it for India. Sarkar shows lack of experience. Kulkarni has been bowling slower balls almost exclusively, but he plays for a regulation delivery and toe-ends this length ball to sky this to mid-on",62/2,436677,9.2,c Ashwin b Kulkarni 40 (47m 34b 5x4 2x6) SR: 117.64,Soumya Sarkar
"how does Raina do this every time? And what a lovely catch by Dhoni. Pindrop silence inMirpur. Raina pushes one through, Rahim looks to make room and cut it between point and third man, but he has misread the length and gets a thick edge. The deflection is big but the ball has caressed into Dhoni's glove. As good as catches off spinners get",112/3,56029,18.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b Raina 24 (35m 30b 0x4 1x6) SR: 80.00,Mushfiqur Rahim
"misses a straight ball. lazy shot. He has just missed a straight ball. Patel bowls as usual in the late 90s, and the bat comes down late to be bowled",118/4,536936,21.5, b Patel 34 (82m 50b 3x4 0x6) SR: 68.00,Liton Das
"Bangladesh have taken a risk too many. Shakib tries the slog sweep yet again, which is okay with Patel, but Raina's delivery stops a touch and gets a massive top edge. Kulkarni runs in from long-on to complete the catch",148/5,56143,26.3,c Kulkarni b Raina 20 (24m 21b 2x4 0x6) SR: 95.23,Shakib Al Hasan
"the mute button has been hit in Mirpur once again, Binny slips in the slower offcutter, Sabbir goes for the drive, but the ball spins in, takes the inside edge before crashing into leg stump, is that the game?",197/6,373538,32.5, b Binny 43 (44m 38b 6x4 0x6) SR: 113.15,Sabbir Rahman
"Mortaza has played eight dots before swinging off the hip. The pressure is showing as he jumps out of the crease pretty early, and Ashwin continues with a slow offbreak to beat him in the flight and turn it through the gate",205/7,56007,35.4, b Ashwin 0 (13m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mashrafe Mortaza
"it's all over now. The last beacon of hope for Bangladesh, Nasir Hossain, is gone. He has seen Sunny is not going to be able to score runs so he knows he has to take the odd risk. He tries to chip this full ball over midwicket, but is early into the shot, and the leading edge off the carrom ball is caught at cover",216/8,300618,39.1,c Rayudu b Ashwin 32 (57m 30b 3x4 0x6) SR: 106.66,Nasir Hossain
"this should seal the Man-of-the-Match awards for Raina. He flights this outside off, Rubel slog-sweeps this, finds no timing or elevation and holes out to long-on. Raina's best figures",222/9,300619,43.2,c Patel b Raina 2 (12m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Rubel Hossain
"there will be no Banglawash. Rayudu fires in a yorker, catches him on the back foot, and gets his wicket",240/10,330902,46.6,lbw b Rayudu 9 (12m 17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 52.94,Mustafizur Rahman
