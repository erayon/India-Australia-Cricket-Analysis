"was looking to flick that over cow corner, but missed the full delivery altogether. He was hit on the back pad too, which meant the ball didn't have to travel much. That would have crashed into middle and leg, as umpire Bruce Oxenford confirmed.",49/1,34102,9.2,lbw b Bracewell 14 (44m 26b 1x4 1x6) SR: 53.84,Rohit Sharma
"loose shot and Rahane's gone. This was way outside off for him to try and get a bat to, but Rahane pokes at that and gets an edge that is taken superbly by Ronchi diving to his right. The bounce did the trick for Neesham",62/2,277916,12.1,c &dagger;Ronchi b Neesham 33 (59m 34b 4x4 2x6) SR: 97.05,Ajinkya Rahane
"goes back to whip it over midwicket, but ends up picking Williamson there. As easy as they come. This was short, he was working it across the line but got it off the top part of the bat.",102/3,290630,19.3,c Williamson b Sodhi 17 (34m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 77.27,Manish Pandey
"MS is run-out. Total breakdown in communication between the pair. Tossed up outside off, Dhoni comes down and misses his flick. The ball ricochets away towards cover off the pad. MS looks at Kohli, Kohli thinks and thinks and thinks. In the meantime, Dhoni is waiting in the middle of the pitch for conformation. Gets a negative response from Kohli, but way too late, especially because Guptill is quick to the ball. Lobs the ball back to the keeper with Dhoni stranded mid-pitch. Kohli is distraught with his decision.",162/4,28081,28.4,run out (Guptill/&dagger;Ronchi) 21 (41m 24b 1x4 1x6) SR: 87.50,MS Dhoni
