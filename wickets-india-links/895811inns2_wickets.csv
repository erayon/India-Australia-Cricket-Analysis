"a wicket finally. The outside edge has been found courtesy some late movement. Good length, drew him forward, Finch went for the drive, but the foot was nowhere to the pitch of the ball, gets a thin edge which MS accepts gleefully. The manner in which he threw the ball up after pouching that had relief written all over it. He doesn't generally get very animated after taking a catch, he was this time.",48/1,5334,7.1,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 21 (30m 23b 3x4 0x6) SR: 91.30,Aaron Finch
"Jadeja strikes in his first over. India find a way past Smith. Jadeja held this one back, gets some turn as well. The outside edge is grazed and Rahane goes low at first slip to pouch it safely",112/2,267192,18.5,c Rahane b Jadeja 41 (45m 45b 5x4 0x6) SR: 91.11,Steven Smith
"beautifully bowled. Ball drifts back in, rips off the surface, turns square, ball zips past Bailey's half-hearted prod, his back foot was in the air as Dhoni collected it cleanly and whipped the bails off in a split second. He made it look so easy. His back foot was on the line. That will definitely even the scales once again. Dhoni knew immediately that it was out. He didn't need confirmation from the third umpire. The giant screen flashes 'OUT' and there's a roar from the Indian contingent.",150/3,4451,26.1,st &dagger;Dhoni b Jadeja 23 (23m 21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 109.52,George Bailey
"huge roar from Ishant, and that tells you how much it means to him! Coming back to the delivery, it was a length ball that was angling across, good seam position, the ball held its line, Marsh nibbled at that one without any conviction, got a thin edge, straightforward catch for MS Dhoni. India back into this big time",167/4,6683,29.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b I Sharma 62 (116m 73b 6x4 0x6) SR: 84.93,Shaun Marsh
"steps out and crunches that wide of mid-off, Umesh gives it chase, turns around and fires a throw towards Dhoni's end. Mitch Marsh was strolling back casually as the stumps are broken down by the Indian captain, who didn't give any hint of rushing in to take the throw at all. Within the bat of an eye lid, the next thing Mitch Marsh knew was the stumps were broken and he was a couple of inches short. How good has Dhoni been with the gloves today?",204/5,272450,35.1,run out (Yadav/&dagger;Dhoni) 17 (24m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 121.42,Mitchell Marsh
"short ball angling away, Wade looks to fetch the pull from outside off, only manages to top edge the pull, Dhawan comes running in from mid-on, settles underneath it and completes a simple catch. Wade didn't look comfortable at all. Was overbalanced too, and the pressure has consumed him when all he had to do was bunt one and give strike to Maxwell. The roar in the Indian camp is back.",215/6,230193,38.1,c S Dhawan b I Sharma 6 (17m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Matthew Wade
"looks for the glory hit, the length ball gets a little big on him, can't get any power behind that attempted slap over cover, Dhawan, running back from mid-off, keeps his eye on the ball and takes it well. It was swirling in the air but he kept his composure. Has come a little too late for India. Maxwell walks off to a huge round of applause. What a knock!",295/7,325026,48.4,c S Dhawan b Yadav 96 (104m 83b 8x4 3x6) SR: 115.66,Glenn Maxwell
