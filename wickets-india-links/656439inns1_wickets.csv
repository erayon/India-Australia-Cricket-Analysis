"gone! Another bouncer, too quick for Berenger to hook. Top edge loops behind him and Dhoni takes a simple catch after taking a couple of steps to his left",7/1,384817,1.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 4 (7m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 44.44,Andri Berenger
"bouncer, Amjad goes for the hook, and it flies through to Dhoni, who appeals loudly for caught behind. Bowden gives it out, and Amjad walks away without complaint or review, so there must have been a thin edge on it. Glove, replays suggest.",13/2,39745,4.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b Kumar 4 (20m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Amjad Ali
"given! Ashwin dangles this slow outside off, entices Krishnan forward to defend. It dips and bounces and that hits his glove, on to thigh pad, and a simple catch to leg slip",28/3,290645,10.2,c Raina b Ashwin 4 (36m 27b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.81,Krishna Chandran
"arm-ball does the trick! Seam pointing towards slip, and it's to that fielder that Patil edges it as he presses forward to defend. Swings away late, and Dhawan takes an excellent catch, diving to his right",41/4,447458,14.5,c Dhawan b Ashwin 7 (17m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 36.84,Swapnil Patil
"and that's number three for Ashwin. Picks the wrong length to sweep on a pitch with this much bounce, gloves it in the air over Dhoni, and Raina moved quickly to his right from slip towards a leg-slip-ish position to take a dolly",44/5,25589,16.4,c Raina b Ashwin 14 (51m 28b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Khurram Khan
"fuller and straighter now, angling towards off stump, and he's been given lbw! Rohan immediately reviews. He was stuck in the crease, looking to defend, but I don't know if that pitched in line. His bat came down at an angle, a long way from the line of the ball, which straightened in off the pitch. Missed his inside edge by a long way and hit him on the back pad, and that is an excellent decision from the umpire. Pitched well in line, actually, and Hawkeye says it would have crashed into off stump",52/6,307808,19.5,lbw b MM Sharma 2 (13m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66,Rohan Mustafa
"and he strikes first ball! Angled in flat with that round-arm action, and it turns away sharply as Amjad comes forward to defend. Edges it into Raina's lap at slip",61/7,25613,21.1,c Raina b Jadeja 2 (7m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Amjad Javed
"gets him with a quicker one and that's four for Ashwin, first time in an ODI. Made room even before the bowler was into his final stride, and he fired a quick arm ball on middle and leg. Too quick for Naveed to cut",68/8,533862,22.3, b Ashwin 6 (4m 7b 0x4 1x6) SR: 85.71,Mohammad Naveed
"bowled him! That was the falling sweep from Tauqir, but unlike Rohan Kanhai he didn't mean to fall. He plonked his front foot across a long way, and he ended up slipping, and the ball, speared in full, sneaked past his left thigh and crashed into leg stump",71/9,25601,23.6, b Jadeja 1 (4m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00,Mohammad Tauqir
"bowled him, all over! Angled in full, late swing away, and Shaiman looks to whip it away through midwicket and the ball swerves past his outside edge and takes out off stump",102/10,43121,31.3, b Yadav 35 (63m 49b 6x4 0x6) SR: 71.42,Shaiman Anwar
