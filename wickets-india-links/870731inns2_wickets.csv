"finally they have caught one and Dhawan walks. He is looking to make room, Taskin remains short and follows him. Dhawan tries the upper cut, but has no space. The edge settles with Rahim",95/1,28235,15.6,c &dagger;Mushfiqur Rahim b Taskin Ahmed 30 (74m 38b 3x4 0x6) SR: 78.94,Shikhar Dhawan
"Kohli has played a loose shot. That itch to feel bat on ball. The crowd has come alive. This is short of a length, wide, and Kohli just hangs his bat out. Even if he nails this nothing shot, he is not going to get a single off this. Which makes it an ordinary shot. And he has edged it. The roof comes off the stadium again, and game is on again. This is proving to be a superb ODI with all the twists and turns",101/2,253802,17.2,c &dagger;Mushfiqur Rahim b Taskin Ahmed 1 (9m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Virat Kohli
"what a big first wicket for Mustafizur. Twenty-five thousand in the stands scream their lungs out. They have gone mad. Bangladesh are on top. Lovely bowling. It's the cutter that has done it. Rohit fails to pick it, looks to work a fullish ball to leg, gets a massive leading edge that settles with Mortaza at mid-off",105/3,34102,20.5,c Mashrafe Mortaza b Mustafizur Rahman 63 (100m 68b 4x4 1x6) SR: 92.64,Rohit Sharma
"lovely catch. Start the party already, Dhaka? Bangladesh get closer to a win? Another slower ball. He bowls a mean cutter. Rahane is early into it. Then to recover he turns the bat face early. The leading edge seams like it is sailing over his head but Nasir Hossain times his jump to perfection. Then he kicks the ball away. And 25000 celebrate with him",115/4,277916,22.6,c Nasir Hossain b Mustafizur Rahman 9 (27m 25b 1x4 0x6) SR: 36.00,Ajinkya Rahane
"lovely sharp catch, and Mushfiq gets in Dhoni's face. This is not a pleasant match, but Bangladesh are playing superbly. There is a previous to this aggressive celebration. Not long ago Dhoni collided with a debutant to send him off the field. Now Shakib draws the edge, quite a thick one as the ball dips and then turns away. Mushfiq takes a lovely catch, letting the ball turn and deflect and taking it almost behind his body, and then screams in Dhoni's face",128/5,28081,25.3,c &dagger;Mushfiqur Rahim b Shakib Al Hasan 5 (13m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 71.42,MS Dhoni
"what a cutter. Mustafizur has his own back. He bowls a mean cutter. It is not easy to pick. Raina is totally deceived by the lack of pace on it. Looks to drive at it away from the body as it pitches on a length outside off. Too early into the shot, and then the ball cuts back in to take the inside edge onto the stumps. Mustafizur is pumped",188/6,33335,36.4, b Mustafizur Rahman 40 (71m 40b 1x4 2x6) SR: 100.00,Suresh Raina
"and out goes Ashwin. Mustafizur is on a hat-trick. Lovely cutter again. He changes the grip at the last possible moment. Later than usual. And the pace dip is not too big. In fact the pace on this slower delivery is enough for a faint edge to carry through to the keeper on a subcontinent pitch. This one pitches on a length, on off, and cuts away to kiss Ashwin's bat",188/7,26421,36.5,c &dagger;Mushfiqur Rahim b Mustafizur Rahman 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Ravichandran Ashwin
"five-for on debut. They are all on his back. They love him. Bangladesh loves him. Mustafizur has run through India with his cutter. It does it once again. Jadeja knows he has to do something. No point playing for a not-out. He looks to hit a six because the asking rate has gone too far, and is undone by the slower ball. Holes out to long-on. Start the party, Dhaka",195/8,234675,38.2,c Soumya Sarkar b Mustafizur Rahman 32 (56m 42b 2x4 0x6) SR: 76.19,Ravindra Jadeja
"and Bangladesh are a step closer. Mushfiqur has turned his own night around after dropping Dhawan twice. This is a slower ball from Mortaza, Sharma makes a bit of room to try to run this down to third man. The ball is slow, takes the edge, and Rahim dives to his right to take it one-handed. That's a fifth catch for Rahim",219/9,537119,42.4,c &dagger;Mushfiqur Rahim b Mashrafe Mortaza 11 (17m 19b 2x4 0x6) SR: 57.89,Mohit Sharma
"that's it. Shakib has provided the finishing touch with an lbw with an arm ball. Trapped in front. Cue big celebration. They have earned it, and deserved it. Mortaza calls Taskin for a chest bump to reprise the World Cup celebrations. And Mortaza performs a mock fall to reprise World Cup again",228/10,376116,45.6,lbw b Shakib Al Hasan 2 (11m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 18.18,Umesh Yadav
