"Zimbabwe into business now as they remove the ever-dangerous Rohit from the middle as he looked to heave away this length delivery through the on side, before getting a leading edge high over to the cover region, with Raza back-peddling a bit before claiming this as he fell onto his back. Didn't quite look the part, but perhaps was looking to up the rate a touch",21/1,34102,6.1,c Sikandar Raza b Panyangara 16 (24m 21b 2x4 0x6) SR: 76.19,Rohit Sharma
Tinashe on fire here at Auckland as Dhawan now has to depart from the middle after attempting an ill-advised cut to this short of a length which was bowled across him. Just wasn't enough room for him to get away the stroke as this crashed back onto the stumps,21/2,28235,6.5, b Panyangara 4 (27m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 20.00,Shikhar Dhawan
"fuller length, outside of off, as this is driven away towards the close-in fielder at cover. Rahane wanted the run, but it was never on as the fielder is able to flick back a throw at the stumps, with Taylor picking up the slack to disturb the bails as Rahane dived. The toe end of the bat may have been in the air though as he tried to ground it in. Very similar to what happened to Chris Jordan recently in the match against Bangladesh. And sure enough, Rahane has to go as his bat was indeed in the air before the bails were disturbed. The misunderstanding has paid dividends for Zimbabwe",71/3,277916,16.3,run out (Sikandar Raza/&dagger;Taylor) 19 (40m 24b 3x4 0x6) SR: 79.16,Ajinkya Rahane
"and out of nowhere Raza has produced a huge wicket as he gets Kohli bowled around his legs, as the batsmen looked for the sweep round the corner. Kohli looked absolutely befuddled once the gravity of the situation came to light. Has to go for another 30-odd score this World Cup. India in real disarray now",92/4,253802,22.4, b Sikandar Raza 38 (71m 48b 4x4 0x6) SR: 79.16,Virat Kohli
