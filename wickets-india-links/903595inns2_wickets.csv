"he tries to whack him over the in field again and he's gone! The ball didn't come in with the angle after pitching outside off, Amla danced down and heaved but the ball turned a wee bit away and beat him completely. Dhoni takes the bails off so quickly in slow motion too",40/1,43906,6.4,st &dagger;Dhoni b Patel 17 (25m 17b 3x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Hashim Amla
"makes room and picks the fielder at long-off, Indore erupts! It was pitched up just outside off with some flight, he went towards leg and lofted it high and straight to Mohit for a simple catch which he had to come forward for",52/2,379143,9.3,c MM Sharma b Harbhajan Singh 34 (35m 36b 5x4 0x6) SR: 94.44,Quinton de Kock
got im this time. Duminy gets down early and looks to hard sweep this but he misses and is struck on the pads. But was that outside the line? Not sure. Maybe not. Umpire Vineet Kulkarni is quick to raise his finger though. Struck him in front that. Good decision,134/3,44932,23.6,lbw b Patel 36 (52m 46b 3x4 0x6) SR: 78.26,Jean-Paul Duminy
this one goes straight to Kohli at cover. Great catch. Faf wanted to go over that man at cover but doesn't get under it enough. He hits it uppishly where Kohli jumps and holds onto a good catch. Massive wicket of the anchor,141/4,44828,25.6,c Kohli b Patel 51 (70m 56b 6x4 0x6) SR: 91.07,Faf du Plessis
and Miller is gone! First delivery. Miller has to walk back. Another big wicket for India. Miller fishes at that and gets an edge through to Dhoni. First-ball duck. Excellent lines from Bhuvneshwar. Dhoni takes a good diving catch too. SA in trouble now.,142/5,321777,26.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Kumar 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,David Miller
"they have got the big man out. AB goes. Not a great shot, to be honest. Hits the ball in the air but too close to Kohli at cover. What a big wicket that is. Fuller length outside off, AB stays back and flat-bats the drive and Kohli dives low to his left and takes a good tumbling catch. Match-changing stuff from Virat.",167/6,44936,32.1,c Kohli b MM Sharma 19 (32m 20b 1x4 1x6) SR: 95.00,AB de Villiers
"gone, first ball. Poor shot from Steyn. Splice-jarring length from Yadav and Steyn looks to play that over cover, not the ball to play that shot to. It hits high on the bat and lobs up to Kohli at cover who takes a good running catch this time.",186/7,47492,36.1,c Kohli b Yadav 13 (18m 16b 1x4 1x6) SR: 81.25,Dale Steyn
"appeal for caught behind mainly from Dhoni, Vineet Kulkarni has given it after some time! Harbhajan did not appeal that hard after turning it down leg, not sure what the ball clipped on the way but Dhoni appealed and got the reward. no pad for sure. Replays and snicko show there was no bat either!",200/8,44410,39.3,c &dagger;Dhoni b Harbhajan Singh 18 (57m 33b 0x4 0x6) SR: 54.54,Farhaan Behardien
"outside edge this time, there was a sound and this time it goes to Dhoni, he leaps and throws the ball high! It wasn't too wide outside off, Tahir pushed at it without moving his feet and got a faint edge",221/9,40618,43.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Kumar 9 (17m 12b 0x4 1x6) SR: 75.00,Imran Tahir
"edged again, taken with both hands by Raina at slip, India have won, Indore erupts! There was some room outside off and MM wanted to force it through the off side. He got a thick edge and Raina caught it over his head at slip",225/10,46538,43.4,c Raina b Kumar 4 (1m 2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200.00,Morne Morkel
