"that's awful! And he's thinking about the review. He takes it! He takes a review after being plumb lbw! Jadhav adds to his legend of picking wickets off innocuous balls. It's that slingshot - low arm, spear in on middle. Dickwella plays a lazy old lapsweep, not keeping in mind this is the rare quicker ball from the part-timer. Struck low on the front pad, in front of middle. Ball-tracking says it would crash into leg stump. Not even umpire's call. An outstanding innings - one that enthralled this packed crowd - ends a little limply and India have an opening.

"he's run right over the ball <b>to be bowled</b>! Axar pulls out a couple of imaginary guns from his pocked to celebrate, and he may well do after this rocket zips through Mendis' defences. The batsman comes charging down, doing so a touch too early, just early enough for the bowler to slip in the quicker ball (104 kph), right into his pads. Mendis plays all around it in his haste to connect. All to no avail. <b><a href=""http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=20394762"" target=""_blank"">Watch the wicket here</a></b>.

"he's even taking wickets off full tosses! The on-field umpires are going to check on its height before sending Tharanga on his way. And replays show the ball is dipping on it way below the waist when the batsman makes contact with a heave. Connects with the higher part of his bat and as a result it settles in nicely at Dhawan's hands at long-on.

"back of a length in the corridior. Drops it into the off side and the non-striker calls him through. Kohli runs in from extra cover and hits the stumps with an underarm flick as he dives forward.

"<b>holes out to mid-on!</b> Kedar Jadhav backtracks, gets the reverse-cup out and tumbles backwards to take a sharp catch. They had mid-on in and the youngster has taken the bait. It's length at middle stump. He's down the track and not to the pitch. Twists out of shape as he looks to slog this. Balls stops slightly on him and bounces as he does so.

"<b>clean bowled.</b> Meek Surrender is the cliche documentary title for this innings, if you're a filmmaker watching this. Overpitched at middle stump. Unlike a nice straight drive earlier in the over, he goes across the line.

"<b>trapped on the back foot.</b> On first look, it's 50-50. Could have been missing off. But they have no reviews left anyway. Good length ball at off and middle.
