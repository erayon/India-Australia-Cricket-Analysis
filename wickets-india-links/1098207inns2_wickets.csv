"shorter now, slants it into the corridor outside off. Slashes at it, and misses. Or has he missed it? India have reviewed - they appealed belatedly for caught behind, and it wasn't given. Didn't look like the most confident appeal, but they reviewed confidently, if that makes any sense, and Snicko proves them right. A fairly discernible edge, even in terms of noise, shows up clearly on Snicko. Outside edge, close to the toe end. Not much room there, and he ended up slashing with an angled bat",0/1,252932,0.3,c &dagger;Dhoni b Kumar 0 (m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Kieran Powell
"and he strikes again. Two in two overs for Bhuvneshwar. Full now, the wide tempter. Mohammed drives with just his hands - his front foot is late in coming across, and his head is nowhere near being over the ball - and slices it uppishly to backward point. Nice low catch from Pandya diving to his left",4/2,230549,2.5,c Pandya b Kumar 0 (m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Jason Mohammed
throws his wicket away. Steps down the track looking for a big hit. Credit to Kuldeep for drawing the batsman forward with some flight. Dips on him and it's a non-turner as well. Makes no contact as he swings and Dhoni completes a straightforward stumping,93/3,431901,19.6,st &dagger;Dhoni b Kuldeep Yadav 21 (m 37b 2x4 0x6) SR: 56.75,Evin Lewis
"appeal for leg before, Gaffaney says not out and India have asked for a review. Front foot is fine. Nicely flighted and dips extremely late. Hope gets down for a sweep but is done in by the last-minute dip. Lands just in front of the pad, sneaks from beneath the willow as the batsman misses the sweep and spins in. Looks pretty close, he could be gone here. No bat involved, certainly. Hitting middle and leg, so the on-field call will be reversed",112/4,581379,25.3,lbw b Kuldeep Yadav 81 (m 88b 5x4 3x6) SR: 92.04,Shai Hope
appeal for lbw and given by umpire Gaffaney. Seemed pretty high at first glance and Carter does not opt for the review. Gets down for a sweep but it's a length ball and hits him quite high. Comes on straight so no question of it being outside the trajectory of the stumps. But height seemed a bit close as it hit him high,132/5,314615,29.2,lbw b Ashwin 13 (m 31b 1x4 0x6) SR: 41.93,Jonathan Carter
