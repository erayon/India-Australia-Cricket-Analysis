"gone! 125 kph, the fourth offcutter of the over. Slow down leg, Dickwella backs away and is flummoxed into playing early (despite it being the fourth straight slower ball). He does and chips a catch to Dhawan at midwicket who leaps up and to his left. That's another start Dickwella has thrown away",41/1,429754,7.4,c Dhawan b Bumrah 31 (m 24b 3x4 2x6) SR: 129.16,Niroshan Dickwella
"a juggle from Dhoni but Gunathilaka is so far out of his crease that Dhoni stays calm, catches the juggle and takes off the bails. Plenty of flight on that from Chahal, may have got some drift too. But Gunathilaka uses his feet as soon as he sees some flight. Misses the line due to that drift, yorks himself and Dhoni makes a tough stumping look tough. Got the job done ably",70/2,345821,14.1,st &dagger;Dhoni b Chahal 19 (m 37b 2x4 0x6) SR: 51.35,Danushka Gunathilaka
"another one! Sri Lanka falling away. Good length outside off, Tharanga fishes at it, gets a thick outside edge and flies straight to a wide slip. That's terrific bowling. The old 1-2, the full, wide ball after the short one, gets just enough lateral movement too, the ball shaping away. Tharanga wafts and pays the price for a flirty, nothing stroke. Good captaincy from Kohli too, to have himself there.",81/3,50747,15.6,c Kohli b Pandya 9 (m 7b 2x4 0x6) SR: 128.57,Upul Tharanga
"<b>opts for the review after being ruled lbw</b>. It wasn't an immediate decision, so there might not be bat involved. Doesn't seem to be on replay as Mendis plays a sweep to a good length ball on middle. ""No bat,"" says the third umpire. Three reds and umpire Martinesz decision stands. Mendis does play this shot very well, but this time, he chooses to do so against a straight and quick delivery. And bringing the bat down across the line off a high backlift takes time. Far too much time on this occasion, certainly",99/4,629074,23.3,lbw b Chahal 19 (m 48b 2x4 0x6) SR: 39.58,Kusal Mendis
"<b>appeal for lbw and Reiffel gives it</b>. Axar strikes, and it's the big one too as Mathews walks back, the second Sri Lankan out sweeping. He plants his front leg across and tries to smack the good length ball on off stump away. But it's just that tiny bit too quick. The umpire took his time, wondering if the impact was in line with off stump, and then said yes. HawkEye show it would have been umpire's call...",121/5,49764,28.3,lbw b Patel 20 (m 41b 2x4 0x6) SR: 48.78,Angelo Mathews
"and gone! 111 kph, slower delivery on off. Siriwardana looks to go straight but the ball skews off the outside half and lobs to cover. An easy catch. But that was a terrific knock, the best of the series for Sri Lanka.",212/6,222354,44.6,c Sharma b Bumrah 58 (m 58b 2x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Milinda Siriwardana
"135 kph, gone underneath the bat this time. Full and straight, Kapugedara can't do much. Gets his hands down too late and the ball sneaks under the bat.",221/7,209457,46.6, b Bumrah 40 (m 61b 2x4 0x6) SR: 65.57,Chamara Kapugedera
"the slower ball and gone! Short and slow on off, Dananjaya slices a pull straight up. Axar runs across from mid-off and takes an easy catch",230/8,574178,48.2,c Patel b Bumrah 9 (m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 81.81,Akila Dananjaya
