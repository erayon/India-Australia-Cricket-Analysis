"another <b>massive appeal for lbw</b> as Dickwella swings right across the line. Bumrah is certain this is out, he's trying to convince Kohli to go for the review, and he finally has. India might have their man here, folks. Searing yorker, beats Dickwella, having pitched on leg stump, hits him low on the pads in front of middle, and then HawkEye projects it to crash into the stumps. Umpire Wilson changes his decision and Sri Lanka have lost their in-form opener early",18/1,429754,3.4,lbw b Bumrah 13 (m 15b 2x4 0x6) SR: 86.66,Niroshan Dickwella
"<b>good grab at second slip by Rohit</b>. The thick outside edge flies to him, demanding him to dive to his right, and he takes it with both hands. Super stuff. Of course, he has that chance to show off because Bumrah keeps hitting the deck and making the ball jag away. Mendis wafts at it, with his feet moving the other way from the shot, and pays for the mistake",28/2,629074,7.4,c Sharma b Bumrah 1 (m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10.00,Kusal Mendis
"he's been banging it in short repeatedly at Chandimal. He's troubled him a few times, and sent down a few long-hops too. This one hurries through and cramps Chandimal for room and he ends up playing an airborne half pull, half flick, and fails to control it. Sends it looping up straight to the man at deep square leg",100/3,300628,25.4,c Bumrah b Pandya 36 (m 71b 4x4 0x6) SR: 50.70,Dinesh Chandimal
"pins him lbw! And Mathews is wondering about the review, he's walking up to his partner and Sri Lanka is taking their review. This is a pretty straight ball, to which the batsman plays a premeditated reverse sweep and misses. It's the one thing he shouldn't be doing after playing such an awful shot, but as is the case when Jadhav has the ball, he has the win. Replays say it pitches in line, hits in line, no bat involved, and will go on to hit middle of middle",138/4,49764,34.4,lbw b Jadhav 11 (m 23b 1x4 0x6) SR: 47.82,Angelo Mathews
"chips it straight to midwicket! And guess who takes the catch? KJ! Takes a bit to make a set batsman look foolish and Bumrah does it with a slightly slower ball. Thirimanne wants to flick it away, but he ends up playing the shot too early and as a result, instead of the ball going squarer, it ends up at Jadhav's hands at midwicket. Gritty knock, untimely end",159/5,301236,39.3,c Jadhav b Bumrah 80 (m 105b 5x4 1x6) SR: 76.19,Lahiru Thirimanne
"he has been playing the inside out drives well, but this time Axar gets a little more drift than he budgeted for. Off goes the leg stump, off goes the Sri Lanka captain, and on continues the Indian celebration",181/6,209457,43.6, b Patel 14 (m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 63.63,Chamara Kapugedera
"swings across the line and the off stump is out of the ground. That's his fourth of the night, and his eighth in two games. Good length, seam up, nips back, too good for a No. 8",191/7,574178,45.5, b Bumrah 2 (m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Akila Dananjaya
"<b>maiden five-for</b>! And he celebrates it with a huge smile on his face. Lovely stuff. Goes full, goes straight, and in response the stumps go flat. Siriwardana had his fun, but this slog doesn't work out.",201/8,222354,47.4, b Bumrah 29 (m 27b 4x4 0x6) SR: 107.40,Milinda Siriwardana
"that bouncer's gained too much height, but not too many are bothered about that because while pinching a bye, Chameera is run-out at the non-strikers' end. Dhoni moves to his left to collect the ball, and quickly sends it across to Bhuvi, who takes a couple of steps to the stumps and underarms it through",210/9,552152,48.5,run out (&dagger;Dhoni/Kumar) 6 (m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Dushmantha Chameera
