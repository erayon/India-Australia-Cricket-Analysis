"he finds success with it as well! I'm half certain this is a knuckle ball. Either way, it was a slightly slower ball, induces a false shot. Dickwella, nervous, jittery, not-sure-if-he-should-hang-in-there-or-hit-out Dickwella goes for a whip across the line and gets a leading edge that is pouched at point",11/1,429754,4.4,c Jadeja b Kumar 7 (20m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 38.88,Niroshan Dickwella
"that was so unnecessary and Gunathilaka is gone I think. Yup, just in the air and India have a wicket courtesy a run-out. A completely unnecessary second run and India have a way back. Worked to backward square leg and Gunathilaka calls for the second. Dhoni picks the throw on the bounce from Umesh yadav and just about takes the bails off in time. A full-length dive can't save Gunathilaka. The ball came out of his glove just after he took off the bails. Lucky for India, but their good fielding has done it again. Happened to Sri Lanka against SA too.",170/2,345821,27.5,run out (Yadav/&dagger;Dhoni) 76 (115m 72b 7x4 2x6) SR: 105.55,Danushka Gunathilaka
"and that's Mendis run-out too. So many run-outs against South Africa changed that game. And two more here. That's an awful call. Pushed towards short mid-on. Bhuvneshwar is quick on the ball, picks up and swivels into a throw to release early, unaware that he had plenty of time. Maybe that helped because it was bang on target at the striker's end. Mendis dives, but he may as well run all the way off. End of a superlative knock but India back on top again",196/3,629074,32.4,run out (Kumar) 89 (113m 93b 11x4 1x6) SR: 95.69,Kusal Mendis
