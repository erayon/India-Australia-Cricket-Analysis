"<b> first ODI wicket for Shardul. </b> Not the kind of delivery he would've liked to get it, but he's off the mark nonetheless. Skiddy length ball on leg stump and going further down, Dickwella looks to tickle this fine but the ball brushes his gloves on the way through to Dhoni. He's good with his reviews. Raveendra Wimalasiri was the umpire in question.",22/1,429754,2.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Thakur 14 (m 11b 3x4 0x6) SR: 127.27,Niroshan Dickwella
"<b> KL Rahul with a direct hit at the bowler's end from point. </b> Kusal Mendis had given up. Terrible, terrible mix-up. This was bunted to point, Kusal was halfway down the pitch when he turned back. In all fairness, Munaweera was never really thinking of the run and said no immediately. Kusal has paid the price for his error in judgment.",26/2,629074,5.2,run out (Rahul) 1 (m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28,Kusal Mendis
"angles in a short of length delivery on middle and leg, Munaweera is on the hop as he looks to tickle this fine and gets a faint glove on it through to Dhoni. So another review that has gone in India's favour. Munaweera's inglorious debut is over. Looked to play a shot at every delivery, didn't connect half of those.",37/3,304735,7.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b Bumrah 11 (m 24b 1x4 0x6) SR: 45.83,Dilshan Munaweera
"and he's gone next ball! Not a wicket-taking ball by any means, short and wide, but he slashes in the air, and only a few yards to the right of Dhawan at deep point",68/4,301236,15.6,c Dhawan b Pandya 18 (m 27b 1x4 1x6) SR: 66.66,Lahiru Thirimanne
"he's been expensive today, but he's picked up a second wicket. Or has he? They're checking for no-ball, and it looks like he has juuuust enough heel behind the line. A good ball, on a good length, wide enough outside off to invite the drive away from the body, and then straightens just a wee bit to kiss the outside edge",141/5,222354,28.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Pandya 39 (m 43b 3x4 2x6) SR: 90.69,Milinda Siriwardana
"<b> he's out by a distance. </b> This was hit towards mid-on, Hasaranga was far too down looking for a non-existent single, turned just as Bumrah ran in quickly and fired the throw. Even then, the run-out wasn't a guarantee. But Axar did well to stop the rocket throw and deflect the ball onto the stumps. <b> It wasn't even his call. </b>",177/6,784379,33.6,run out (Bumrah/Patel) 22 (m 22b 2x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Wanindu Hasaranga
"reward finally, but not before he's been carted to all corners of the park. Axar does well too, tosses this up nicely, bows it much wider too, which meant Mathews had to reach out to slog this across the line, he tried to but ended up getting a toe-end of the bat as short third man gobbled up the top edge. Axar's reaction tells you he's had a bad day and not even the wicket of a quality batsman is some balm.",190/7,49764,37.2,c Thakur b Patel 70 (m 80b 10x4 0x6) SR: 87.50,Angelo Mathews
"helped to third man. This was a short ball, not a very threatening one though. Milinda swayed inside the line of the delivery and simply directed this straight to Hardik Pandya. As easy as they come. The end is near.",196/8,50205,41.2,c Pandya b Bumrah 3 (m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66,Malinda Pushpakumara
"simple return catch. Kuldeep has deceived him in flight. Fernando looked for a big, booming drive but could only hit it back off a thick inside edge.",207/9,465783,42.3,c &amp; b Kuldeep Yadav 5 (m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125.00,Vishwa Fernando
"got him with a big spinning delivery. Landed this just outside off, Malinga went for a big swipe, but could only connect with the humid evening air. Nowhere near the pitch of the ball and lost his middle stump. The plug has been pulled finally. <b> This is Sri Lanka's biggest defeat at home in terms of runs. </b>",207/10,49758,42.4, b Kuldeep Yadav 0 (m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Lasith Malinga
