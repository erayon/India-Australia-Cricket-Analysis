"edged and taken! Mohit has see-sawed this way and that with his length. This time a back of a good length delivery gets a little more bounce. Amla thought it was there to cut with the room on offer, but with the ball rising up higher, it takes the edge and settles in Dhoni's gloves. Mohit just looks relived. Kohli roars from mid-off. And Wankhede goes ""Indiaaaaa.... India""",33/1,43906,3.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b MM Sharma 23 (18m 13b 5x4 0x6) SR: 176.92,Hashim Amla
"taken at long-off and Raina has broken through! Came down the track for a heave over the leg side, but he has not got close enough for the ball to hit against the turn.

"Oh, the short ball gets him! And Wankhede stands up to salute him. ""ABD, ABD, ABD"" they cant as he raises his bat to them. The Indians come to congratulate him as well. Now for the small matter of the ball that did him - a slower short one that he tried to pull off the front foot. Feathered an edge to the keeper",398/3,44936,46.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Kumar 119 (98m 61b 3x4 11x6) SR: 195.08,AB de Villiers
"a wicket off a short ball, Bhajji has one in the wicket column. Behardien went for the clear the front leg pull, but did not get the elevation. Caught at midwicket",430/4,44410,49.2,c Raina b Harbhajan Singh 16 (11m 10b 0x4 2x6) SR: 160.00,Farhaan Behardien
