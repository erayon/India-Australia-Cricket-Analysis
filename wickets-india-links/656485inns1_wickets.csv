"comes down the track to try and drive Shakib through the covers, but the flight beats him as he went with the down swing. Mushfiqur is alert to the stumping chance as he collects this before whipping off the bails in a flash. The back foot looked like it might be dragging outside of the crease. Replays show that Dhawan indeed has his back foot outside the crease when the bails were successfully removed. Huge roar from the Bangladeshi contingent at the MCG as Shikhar is given his marching orders",75/1,28235,16.3,st &dagger;Mushfiqur Rahim b Shakib Al Hasan 30 (74m 50b 3x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Shikhar Dhawan
"Kohli is gone. Bangladesh have a big wicket here. Delivers a fullish length delivery, pitched wide outside off, as Kohli is instinctively drawn into the drive, with the ball catching the outside edge to fly over to the keeper, who is able to take a good, low catch to this right to pluck a huge, huge wicket for the Bangla tigers. There was some away shape to the ball, which also played a part in the dismissal",79/2,253802,17.5,c &dagger;Mushfiqur Rahim b Rubel Hossain 3 (6m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 37.50,Virat Kohli
"fuller delivery, outside off, and Rahane's struggle has come to an end as he mistimes the loft over extra-cover, with the bat turning in his hand, as the ball ends up just to the left of Shakib, who dives in the end as he claimed it. Bangladesh cock-a-hoop after that dismissal. India looking in some trouble now at 115 for 3. Hilarity ensues as Taskin and Mashrafe went for the celebratory chest-bump, which they fail on the first occassion, before trying again to save face. This time however, they both fail miserably as Taskin slips. Comical end to a key wicket there for Bangladesh",115/3,277916,27.6,c Shakib Al Hasan b Taskin Ahmed 19 (38m 37b 1x4 0x6) SR: 51.35,Ajinkya Rahane
"looking for the almighty heave over midwicket, but ends up top-edging this length delivery high over his head, with Mushfiqur, who called it early, having to take a few paces back before settling under it nicely. Ends an integral knock from Raina, who has really put India into a strong position here in the latter overs",237/4,33335,43.5,c &dagger;Mushfiqur Rahim b Mashrafe Mortaza 65 (81m 57b 7x4 1x6) SR: 114.03,Suresh Raina
"ends the Rohit special with a full, inswinging delivery which the right-hander looked to glide away through third man as he got low. Ends up playing this one on after the ball hit the ground. Ends one of the all-time best knocks for India in a crucial World Cup match",273/5,34102,46.6, b Taskin Ahmed 137 (223m 126b 14x4 3x6) SR: 108.73,Rohit Sharma
"looking for quick runs with a thwack through the leg side to this shortish length, but ends up getting a leading edge high over towards the cover point region, with the fielder getting under it rather comfortably in the end",296/6,28081,48.6,c Nasir Hossain b Taskin Ahmed 6 (28m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 54.54,MS Dhoni
