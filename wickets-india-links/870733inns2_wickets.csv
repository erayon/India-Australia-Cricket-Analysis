"slower full ball outside off, Kulkarni rolls his fingers across it, Tamim looked to carve that through cover, top edges it for a loopy catch to slip, India get their first",34/1,56194,6.2,c Dhawan b Kulkarni 13 (28m 21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 61.90,Tamim Iqbal
"this is a shooter to get Sarkar out. Flatter, quicker delivery, pitches on a length, Sarkar is justified in staying back, but the ball doesn't come up. It squeezes under the toe of the bat to hit him in the shin. No chance for Sarkar really",86/2,436677,16.4,lbw b Ashwin 34 (70m 47b 2x4 1x6) SR: 72.34,Soumya Sarkar
"Dhoni takes the catch on the rebound, India are still in. A loose shot. Bangladesh getting complacent here. This is a flat length ball outside off, Das pushes at it, away from his body, and edges it through. Dhoni's gloves close early but the rebound doesn't go too far away. India very much in this contest",98/3,536936,19.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Patel 36 (52m 41b 5x4 0x6) SR: 87.80,Liton Das
"short and wide, cut away square of deep cover. He comes back for a second run, but Rahim's strides and Dhoni's fox-like work runs him out. The throw is not exceptionally fast so he leaves his station at the stumps, moves towards the stumps, and then deflects it between his legs with his back to the stumps. Guess what, he has hit the stumps. That is some work by MS Dhoni",152/4,56029,29.1,run out (Sharma/&dagger;Dhoni) 31 (41m 34b 3x4 1x6) SR: 91.17,Mushfiqur Rahim
