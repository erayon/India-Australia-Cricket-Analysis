"Gone, and that's Malinga's 299th in ODIs! Not enough room for the cut, and he stays leg-side of the ball and tries to chop it away. A bit of inward shape, and all he can do is inside-edge into his middle stump. This was the sort of ball most left-hand batsmen would have looked to get behind and play towards mid-on or midwicket, not even mid-off",9/1,28235,2.1, b Malinga 5 (m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 166.66,Shikhar Dhawan
"gone! Fernando's got his man. Not the way he must have visualised getting the Indian captain out, but he won't care. It's not exactly a wicket-taking ball, on the pads and asking to be flicked. But Kohli's maybe a touch early on it, and maybe the left-armer's inswing makes him hit it finer than he'd like, and he ends up flicking in the air, to the man stationed at long leg. Chameera's the fielder, and he takes it brilliantly, diving forward as it dips on him",19/2,253802,5.1,c Chameera b Fernando 3 (m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 27.27,Virat Kohli
"googly, but it's also a long-hop, but that doesn't matter, because Rahul has picked out the fielder at deep midwicket with his pull. What a way to get out. It was almost as if he was telling himself he would impose himself on Dananjaya today, and then his eyes lit up as soon as he saw the short ball, but he failed to take enough precautions to keep his shot down or hit it away from that man on the boundary. He just had to run a few yards to his left and accept the simplest of catches",61/3,422108,13.5,c Thirimanne b Dananjaya 17 (m 24b 2x4 0x6) SR: 70.83,Lokesh Rahul
"<b>does him again!</b>. For the second time in two matches, Dananjaya gets rid of Jadhav. This one is the legbreak, tossed up and straight. The batsman goes for a sweep, hitting right across the line and missing completely. Hits him on the back thigh as he is kneeling and umpire Wilson says that's adjacent. HawkEye confirms that's three reds.",61/4,290716,15.1,lbw b Dananjaya 0 (m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Kedar Jadhav
