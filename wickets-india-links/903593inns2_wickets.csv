"given lbw! But was that missing leg? The ball was quite full from round the wicket, angling into the left-hander. Dhawan was caught on the crease and hit on the pad as he looked to play on the leg side. Morkel went up immediately, and the umpire followed after a short pause ... it did look like that would have missed leg stump, or just about clipped it.",42/1,28235,7.3,lbw b Morkel 23 (33m 28b 5x4 0x6) SR: 82.14,Shikhar Dhawan
a soft dismissal to break the stand! Rahane made room by moving outside leg and slapped an innocuous delivery straight to Miller at extra cover. His partnership with Rohit ends on 149,191/2,277916,33.4,c Miller b Behardien 60 (117m 82b 5x4 0x6) SR: 73.17,Ajinkya Rahane
"has he been caught at short fine leg? What a take! Steyn bowled a half-volley on the pads, a delivery Kohli should have put away. He flicked the ball uppishly but it was dying on the tall Morne Morkel at short fine leg. Morkel got down low and caught the ball in his fingertips before it hit the ground. Is the tide turning decisively now?",214/3,253802,39.6,c Morkel b Steyn 11 (29m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 61.11,Virat Kohli
"he's been caught and bowled! Rohit stepped out of his crease but was beaten by the flight of the legbreak, he wasn't to the pitch of the ball and ended up punching it tamely right back at Tahir, who sets off on an epic celebratory run after taking the catch. He'll tire himself out on such a hot day!",269/4,34102,46.1,c &amp; b Imran Tahir 150 (215m 133b 13x4 6x6) SR: 112.78,Rohit Sharma
"Tahir has got another one! Raina has barely had a chance to get his eye in but he can't afford to either. He aims to slam a googly over the midwicket boundary and ends up mis-hitting it towards long on, where Duminy takes the catch",273/5,33335,46.5,c Duminy b Imran Tahir 3 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Suresh Raina
"Dhoni has been caught and bowled! This is an innings that will be discussed for a while now. He's charged the young fast bowler and aimed a slog across the line, he top edged the ball high in the air and Rabada calls for it coolly and takes the catch. Dhoni fails to see India through, they need seven off two balls.",297/6,28081,49.4,c &amp; b Rabada 31 (54m 30b 1x4 0x6) SR: 103.33,MS Dhoni
"Rabada has all but done it for South Africa! Binny also too edges the pull and skies the catch to square leg, Rabada tries to go for it himself again, but leaves it to Amla who comes running in to catch it.",297/7,27223,49.5,c Amla b Rabada 2 (18m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Stuart Binny
