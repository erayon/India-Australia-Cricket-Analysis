"Another appeal for leg before. The forefinger goes up now. Fuller length and slides in to hit Hami M on the front pad on the knee-roll, this is in line with off and he has to go for 7 off 24 balls",16/1,55608,5.3,lbw b Sharma 7 (23m 24b 1x4 0x6) SR: 29.16,Hamilton Masakadza
Played on! Axar strikes and breaks the partnership. Arm-ball arrows in with the angle... Chakabva leans back and aims to cut it through the off side. He does not connect properly and edges it onto the stumps. Axar celebrates,86/2,293831,22.1, b Patel 27 (69m 43b 3x4 0x6) SR: 62.79,Regis Chakabva
"Vijay gets Chigumbura first ball. His maiden ODI wicket. He leaps for joy and clicks his heels. Flatter and quicker, turns in. Chigumbuara misses the flick and is rapped on the front pad in line with the stumps",97/3,55343,25.1,lbw b Vijay 10 (10m 14b 2x4 0x6) SR: 71.42,Elton Chigumbura
"a big appeal for lbw, Mutumbami has been given out. Looked plumb. The umpires check for a possible no-ball. Binny is <i>just about okay</i>.. His heel is just behind the line. Mutumbami does not connect with the flick and is rapped on the front pad in front of middle and then pings him on the back pad. It would have crashed into middle and leg",150/4,235516,34.6,lbw b Binny 22 (45m 24b 3x4 0x6) SR: 91.66,Richmond Mutumbami
"Taken by Jadhav. Good length and on middle, he goes for another pick-up shot. Chibhabha does not middle it. Jadhav runs in from deep midwicket and snaffles a good catch",160/5,55354,36.2,c Jadhav b Binny 82 (155m 109b 7x4 0x6) SR: 75.22,Chamu Chibhabha
"Harbhajan logs himself into the wickets column in his final over. Pushed across on off from round the stumps, Raza, having stepped away outside leg, can't connect with the dab down to third man again. Harbhajan shatters the off stump. It lies flat on the floor...",172/6,299572,37.4, b Harbhajan Singh 13 (15m 10b 2x4 0x6) SR: 130.00,Sikandar Raza
"two wickets in two balls for Harbhajan. He gives this ample air on middle, chipped tamely to short midwicket. Jinxy flings himself forward and completes a sharp, low catch",172/7,55346,37.5,c Rahane b Harbhajan Singh 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Graeme Cremer
"Binny takes down Waller now. Fuller and seams away outside off, Waller seeks to drive and outside-edges it to Rahane, who is rather wide at slip",176/8,55872,38.5,c Rahane b Binny 5 (17m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 62.50,Malcolm Waller
"Utseya top-edges it, Uthappa settles under it. Lifting short ball, gets big on Utseya. He mis-controls a hook behind. Zimbabwe nine down",176/9,55820,39.1,c &dagger;Uthappa b Sharma 0 (9m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Prosper Utseya
"The square-leg umpires raises his finger. India sweep the series 3-0! Axar gives this loads of air outside off, Madziva flits down the track, goes for a big swing and does not connect. Uthappa does the rest, making no mistake",193/10,453289,42.4,st &dagger;Uthappa b Patel 3 (15m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Neville Madziva
