"gone! Too close to cut, and he stayed inside the line and poked at it with an angled bat. Came in off the pitch, and a thin but easily discernible edge through to Dhoni",8/1,53118,4.5,c &dagger;Dhoni b Mohammed Shami 6 (19m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 30.00,Dwayne Smith
"It's all happening, there's a run-out, and I'll have to take a moment to figure out exactly what all happened. It was short, and too quick for Gayle to pull from outside off. Hit high on the bat, fell short of Mohit running forward from mid-on and diving. Samuels wanted the single, Gayle was ball-watching, and both were at the batsman's end when Mohit threw to the other end. Kohli backed up quickly from cover to complete the run-out",15/2,52983,7.2,run out (MM Sharma/Kohli) 2 (14m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57,Marlon Samuels
"short ball, and Gayle simply couldn't control that pull from outside off. Skied it way up over the leg side, and he pretty much picked out the only fielder deep on the leg side, safe catch from Mohit at deep square leg",35/3,51880,8.6,c MM Sharma b Mohammed Shami 21 (44m 27b 2x4 1x6) SR: 77.77,Chris Gayle
"and he's gone, first ball! That was full outside off, and he went hard at the cover drive, with an angled bat, and only managed to drag it onto his stumps, off the inside edge",35/4,52917,9.1, b Yadav 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Denesh Ramdin
"another wicket off a short ball. It's banged in outside off, and Simmons is really in no position to hook it. Top-edges it and Umesh takes a simple catch at long leg",67/5,53116,18.1,c Yadav b MM Sharma 9 (39m 22b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.90,Lendl Simmons
"aaand he's gone. The sweep does him in. On this pitch, one ball is going to bounce a bit more, especially when Ashwin's flighting the ball this well. Top-edges it, and Shami came in a little too far from the long leg boundary, but he kept his eyes on the ball and stretched to his right, over his head, and backwards, to catch it in both hands",71/6,314615,21.5,c Mohammed Shami b Ashwin 21 (67m 43b 3x4 0x6) SR: 48.83,Jonathan Carter
"aaand he strikes first ball. Sees a bit of air outside off and Russell goes for a big hit straightaway, hits across the the line, and top-edges a loopy catch to Kohli coming in from long-off.",85/7,276298,24.1,c Kohli b Jadeja 8 (13m 8b 0x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Andre Russell
"gone! That's a back of a length ball, angling in towards Sammy from wide of the crease. The batsman was looking to make room to play through the off side and it followed him, and he had to poke at it with his feet in the air, and ended up nicking it to the keeper, off the shoulder of the bat",124/8,53115,35.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Mohammed Shami 26 (69m 55b 2x4 0x6) SR: 47.27,Darren Sammy
"bouncer outside off, goes for the hook, top-edges it, and this time he pops it in the air, and Umesh moves to his right from his follow-through and takes a simple catch",175/9,53191,42.6,c &amp; b Yadav 11 (30m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 61.11,Jerome Taylor
"oh, he's holed out! It was a good length ball and as the batsmen before him, he tried to make too much of it. Poor heave ends up as a slice that the long-off fielder has no trouble with",182/10,391485,44.2,c Kohli b Jadeja 57 (79m 64b 4x4 3x6) SR: 89.06,Jason Holder
