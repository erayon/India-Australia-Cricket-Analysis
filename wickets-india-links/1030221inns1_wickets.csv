"unplayable! Guptill could do nothing about that. A quick bowler's delight. Fuller than a good length - quite the ideal length. Guptill prods, played the line, didn't account for swing. Umesh got it to move away just enough, like the previous delivery, to beat Guptill's outside edge. Clatters into off stump. Not sure if that was bad batting or just sensational bowling. He did see a bit of swing off the previous delivery. Anyway, Guptill has failed again.",0/1,226492,0.2, b Yadav 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Martin Guptill
"Latham's been given lbw, and it looks like the ball might have been missing leg stump! He went back to one angled into him from around the wicket and closed the face of the bat. The ball skidded on with the arm and hit the outside half of the front pad. That might have been clipping leg stump, at best",120/2,388802,20.3,lbw b Jadhav 46 (86m 46b 6x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Tom Latham
"caught on the slog-swipe at deep midwicket. Taylor has fallen to the plan. Mishra bowled the ball faster and outside off stump, Taylor met it with a lunge on the front foot and dragged it from outside off, he hit it quite a long way but not long enough to clear Rohit Sharma on the edge of the boundary",158/3,38699,30.6,c Sharma b Mishra 21 (44m 42b 2x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Ross Taylor
"given this time, may have been the seam-up delivery. Full and straight on off and middle, Anderson looked to work that ball into the leg side. Did he hit that off the face? There was definitely two pads on that. Straight and umpire Chaudhary gives him this time. Was plumb if there was no bat. A 102 kph quicker delivery from Mishra.",204/4,277662,40.5,lbw b Mishra 21 (46m 32b 2x4 0x6) SR: 65.62,Corey Anderson
"taken! Beautiful bowling, beautiful shot. Lovely catch. Again, Mishra shortens the length and ensures Williamson doesn't get to the pitch of the ball as he shimmies down. Despite not getting there, Williamson lofts his drive straight. Full face of the bat. Would have got enough on that had he got closer to the ball, but didn't as Rahane gets across from his right at long-on to take a good catch near the boundary. End of a really  tunning innings",213/5,277906,42.4,c Rahane b Mishra 118 (183m 128b 14x4 1x6) SR: 92.18,Kane Williamson
"and gone! NZ struggling. Short and wide outside off, a bad ball in all fairness. Ronchi goes back and gets a thick outside edge to Dhoni who takes a good catch. Dhoni's right leg went up in instinct. A poor shot from Ronchi, didn't account for the bounce or played under that. NZ in trouble now",216/6,7502,43.3,c &dagger;Dhoni b Patel 6 (11m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Luke Ronchi
"a one-handed screamer from Axar. Not a great catch just because it was with one hand. A slower ball from Bumrah, Devich gets across and paddles him over short fine leg. or that's what it looks like. Axar keeps his eyes on the ball even as the ball seems to evade him, but he stick out his right hand (his non-dominant) and clings on. NZ sink deeper",224/7,36948,45.1,c Patel b Bumrah 7 (8m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 116.66,Anton Devcich
"and gets him this time with an even better yorker. The first one was slightly leg side-ish, but he adjusts the line this time. More towards off stump, goes under Southee's bat and pegs back the off stump. A fantastic display of end-overs bowling, especially to new batsmen.",225/8,232364,45.5, b Bumrah 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Tim Southee
"slower ball and goes through Henry. Way too early into his heave. A yorker and a slower ball does for Henry, the yorker equally responsible for this wicket. Henry swings across the line, misses and the off stump is pegged back again",237/9,506612,49.2, b Bumrah 6 (15m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Matt Henry
