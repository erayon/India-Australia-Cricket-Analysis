"Hits it straight down the throat of deep midwicket. Pakistan, finally, break the rousing opening stand. This seemed to have slipped out of his hand, Dhawan races down the track, takes a full-toss and mows it straight to Azhar Ali in the deep",136/1,28235,24.3,c Azhar Ali b Shadab Khan 68 (95m 65b 6x4 1x6) SR: 104.61,Shikhar Dhawan
"tossed up outside off, and Kohli may have endangered Rohit's innings here. Stretches out and pushes into the point region, calls immediately for the single. Babaz runs in quickly from backward point, fires in a throw to Sarfraz, and Rohit, diving desperately, could be out in slightly unfortunate fashion here, his bat bouncing at impact and the part that is past the crease in the air when the bails go off. Is the bat in the air? The third umpire is checking. Given out, and from the angles shown, that seemed the right conclusion. They only showed the angle from point, though, not from square leg",192/2,34102,36.4,run out (Babar Azam/&dagger;Sarfraz Ahmed) 91 (146m 119b 7x4 2x6) SR: 76.47,Rohit Sharma
"big appeal for lbw, Marais Erasmus isn't interested. Sarfraz asks for a review. Full, a near-yorker close to leg stump. Yuvraj looks to flick, misses, and the ball hits his foot. Did that pitch outside leg, though? No bat on it, I think. HotSpot suggests the toe of the bat hit the ground. Big distance between bat and ball. What says ball-tracking? Pitching just in line, and once we've established that, Yuvraj will have to walk back. That's crashing into middle stump, fairly low",285/3,36084,46.2,lbw b Hasan Ali 53 (49m 32b 8x4 1x6) SR: 165.62,Yuvraj Singh
