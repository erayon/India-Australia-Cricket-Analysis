"tame dismissal, and Nair has had a forgettable ODI debut. Tennis ball bounce on that one, there was a hint of grip on that as well, so Nair couldn't really generate the power he would have liked on the cut shot. Looked like he wanted to pull out of the stroke at the last moment, but it was too late as the ball went off the toe end of the bat to Raza at short cover. There's the early breakthrough Zimbabwe wanted.",11/1,398439,4.3,c Sikandar Raza b Chatara 7 (19m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 35.00,Karun Nair
