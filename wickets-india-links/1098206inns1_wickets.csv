"scoops it up - totally deceived by the slower ball. Not the first time lack of pace has been Rahane's undoing. He likes the ball coming on, hitting through the line, all that. Joseph disallows that luxury with an offspinner, a teasing one. Rahane steps forward, looking to hit over mid-off, but skews it instead straight to the West Indies captain at mid-on",132/1,277916,24.6,c Holder b Joseph 62 (m 78b 8x4 0x6) SR: 79.48,Ajinkya Rahane
"takes his time, does Dharmasena, but up comes the finger. Dhawan's lbw. But wait, he's called for the DRS. This is pushed through off the front of the hand. That is why it skids through to hit the batsman - playing across the line towards midwicket - low on the front pad. Snicko indicates no bat. Ball tracker says it pitched in line and will hit the stumps as well. That's three reds and he's outta here",168/2,28235,31.5,lbw b Bishoo 87 (m 92b 8x4 2x6) SR: 94.56,Shikhar Dhawan
"finds midwicket! All those dot balls and all that pressure. And Yuvraj feels he needs to do something. Gets across to a nothing delivery on leg. Full on the pads. Since, Yuvraj feels he needs a boundary, instead of a single, he tries to hit a gap past midwicket. All he does is pick him out to perfection. At least, the timing was sensational.",185/3,36084,36.3,c Lewis b Holder 4 (m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Yuvraj Singh
