"Sharma has a brain freeze. He does that every now and then. Makes up his mind to play a particular shot even before the ball is bowled. Here he has decided this has to be pulled no matter what. The ball is not short enough, he is pulling off the front foot, and the ball gets big on him. The top edge lobs up for a simple catch for Misbah running in from mid-off. A typical Sharma dismissal",34/1,34102,7.3,c Misbah-ul-Haq b Sohail Khan 15 (35m 20b 2x4 0x6) SR: 75.00,Rohit Sharma
"quicker, Kohli is back even though the ball is full. Worked towards midwicket. Dhawan wants a single. Kohli sends him back. This is Kohli's. Dhawan dives but can't beat the throw. Just the fillip Pakistan needed. Turns out Kohli has sold him down the river. He has started out for the single, but realises late that it is not on. And Shehzad is quick and accurate with the throw",163/2,28235,29.5,run out (Misbah-ul-Haq) 73 (136m 76b 7x4 1x6) SR: 96.05,Shikhar Dhawan
Kohli is gone. Gets a wide half-volley that he is not quite close to. He edges it and Pakistan finally hold on to an offering from Kohli. Kohli raises his bat to the crowd as he walks off. Big innings in a big match,273/3,253802,45.2,c &dagger;Umar Akmal b Sohail Khan 107 (168m 126b 8x4 0x6) SR: 84.92,Virat Kohli
"Raina is gone. Finally to the short ball. But after having scored 74 off 56. This has hurried onto him, and has taken the top edge",284/4,33335,47.3,c Haris Sohail b Sohail Khan 74 (78m 56b 5x4 3x6) SR: 132.14,Suresh Raina
"slower ball this time at the base of the off stump, and Jadeja is beaten slogging. Beats me why Rahane hasn't come out to bat yet. India might fall 20 short of what they were looking good for. Good bowling by Pakistan over the last five overs",296/5,234675,48.6, b Wahab Riaz 3 (7m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Ravindra Jadeja
and Dhoni has failed to finish again. This is reaching proportions of concern. Short ball. Beaten for pace. Late into the pull. Top-edges this for an easy catch for mid-off,296/6,28081,49.1,c Misbah-ul-Haq b Sohail Khan 18 (22m 13b 1x4 1x6) SR: 138.46,MS Dhoni
"Sohail is doing the sajda after bowling Rahane out. Slower ball, Rahane makes room to try to hit it over cover, and has the top of the leg stumps disturbed. Will we get another last-over hat-trick?",296/7,277916,49.2, b Sohail Khan 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Ajinkya Rahane
