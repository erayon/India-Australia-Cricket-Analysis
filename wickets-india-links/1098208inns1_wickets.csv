"<b>Dhawan has a single digit score</b> after nine 50-over innings for India. A tame shot. This is slightly short and climbing in the corridor. He arches back and looks to lift this over to the third man region - not clever, considering third man is in place. He finds him perfectly",11/1,28235,2.4,c Chase b Cummins 2 (m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Shikhar Dhawan
"<b>oh good catch!</b> Kyle Hope has made amends! Back of a length outside off stump, he's on the front foot early and then he sees this lift up off the pitch. It's chest height and he pokes at it. Thick outside edge that hangs to the left of gully for a moment, before the fielder there, Hope, leaps one-handed to his left and gets rid of Kohli. Holder has his man",34/2,253802,9.3,c KA Hope b Holder 11 (m 22b 2x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Virat Kohli
"lbw appeal, much louder this time, as Yuvraj comes forward hesitantly to defend. Given not out, they've reviewed this time... Again Bishoo gets it to dip onto a lovely length - straightens just enough to clip the front pad before it hits Yuvraj's inside edge. He's only half forward. Pitches just inside the line, leg-stumpish, and ball-tracking says it's hitting off stump. Excellent delivery, not the greatest technique against spin, and Yuvraj has to go",100/3,36084,26.2,lbw b Bishoo 39 (m 55b 4x4 0x6) SR: 70.90,Yuvraj Singh
"<b>sensational catch</b> from Bishoo. Showed great awareness to his right the previous ball, and this time he jogs to his left from sweeper cover and times a dive perfectly to catch low to his left. Back of a length from Cummins, Rahane looked to find the gap over point, but there was no width, skewed it uppishly",170/4,277916,42.2,c Bishoo b Cummins 72 (m 112b 4x4 1x6) SR: 64.28,Ajinkya Rahane
