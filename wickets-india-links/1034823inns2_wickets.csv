"late swing, beautiful late, glorious swing and Rahane is out cheaply. His feet are shackled to the crease. He is driving down the wrong line. He is not ready for this full delivery to scythe through the air, through his gap between bat and pad and take the off stump. So England's cost for their non-appeal is one mere run",13/1,277916,1.4, b Willey 1 (8m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66,Ajinkya Rahane
"that's straight up. This will take some catching and the man with the gloves calls for it. Sensible. Ball strikes in his first over. And he does so with Rahul trying to take the game on quite unnecessarily. He is on the front foot, looking to pull a back of a length delivery on middle. The bat comes down under the ball as it bounces more than Rahul expects. India repaying the favours Billings and Morgan did them.",37/2,422108,5.6,c &dagger;Buttler b Ball 11 (28m 11b 1x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Lokesh Rahul
"they get him outside off! With just enough nibble, keeping the ball up, tempting Kohli to play on the up, play an expansive shot and the cover drive becomes a thick edge, so much that Buttler has to jump up and take the catch almost above his shoulder. The umpires check the no-ball, Stokes is safe and India lose their captain",102/3,253802,19.4,c &dagger;Buttler b Stokes 55 (81m 63b 8x4 0x6) SR: 87.30,Virat Kohli
"he's found the man at deep midwicket. India making the same errors England did earlier. And we're even now. Takes a length ball on middle, flicks it in the air, despite the man in the deep, and pays the price for the carelessness",133/4,36084,25.3,c Billings b Plunkett 45 (82m 57b 5x4 1x6) SR: 78.94,Yuvraj Singh
"edged and taken by Buttler, another sharp catch, well above his shoulder to his right. Ball has had a fine night, coming back after putting Kohli down earlier. This one's on a good length, outside off, draws the big shot from Dhoni and a little extra bounce takes the top edge through to the wicketkeeper. Odd sort of shot from Dhoni, considering there is so much time left in the game, driving away from the body when all innings he hid on the back foot",173/5,28081,31.4,c &dagger;Buttler b Ball 25 (45m 36b 1x4 1x6) SR: 69.44,MS Dhoni
"he's bowled him. Stokes, the talisman. England's gun player. He does it again. It's all quite simple really. Just a good length ball aimed at the stumps. You miss I hit territory and Pandya misses with an almighty slog. Walks off with a grimace",277/6,625371,45.3, b Stokes 56 (67m 43b 4x4 2x6) SR: 130.23,Hardik Pandya
"picks out deep midwicket and Bairstow turns around to the crowd and exults. The game turns again! This is the back of a length delivery outside off, Jadeja hammers it right off the middle, but he fails to pick the gap.",291/7,234675,46.5,c Bairstow b Woakes 10 (8m 6b 2x4 0x6) SR: 166.66,Ravindra Jadeja
hits it straight up and Woakes takes a pressure catch at mid-on. Stokes exorcising the demons from the World T20. he goes for the length ball. He threatens the stumps. He makes the batsman make the play and Ashwin panics. Swings blind and mistimes badly,297/8,26421,47.5,c Woakes b Stokes 1 (5m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Ravichandran Ashwin
"taken at deep point. Woakes does it. Billings does it. England edge ahead. This is a fuller ball outside off, Jadhav goes for a slice, he hasn't timed it. It's because the ball was wider, away from his reach. Robs him of his timing and off he walks having smashed 90 off 75! Top innings. Standing ovation from his team-mates. But will it be enough for India?",316/9,290716,49.5,c Billings b Woakes 90 (118m 75b 12x4 1x6) SR: 120.00,Kedar Jadhav
