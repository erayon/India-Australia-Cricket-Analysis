"chips it straight to short midwicket! The most innocuous of deliveries. Full on middle. There for the flick. But he has not timed the ball. It's that old weakness of his, unable to force the pace when the pitch becomes slow. He was not quite to the pitch of the ball, it held up on the surface a bit and he didn't make much of an effort the keep it down. The ball didn't come on, he found Latham",40/1,277916,9.2,c Latham b Neesham 20 (45m 39b 3x4 0x6) SR: 51.28,Ajinkya Rahane
"the bouncer gets him! This is at full pace. Rising above Rohit's chest. Cramping him for room. The batsman goes for the pull, but top edges it and it is pouched safely by Neesham at deep midwicket",119/2,34102,21.6,c Neesham b Boult 70 (107m 65b 5x4 3x6) SR: 107.69,Rohit Sharma
"pinned in front! Went for the sweep, but he has chosen a bad ball to do so. It was too straight. Slow as well, which meant he was finished with the shot by the time it hit his front pad. And worse, it straightened after angling in, pitching on middle. Fairly easy decision for Nandan, on his ODI debut as an umpire.",190/3,28081,37.3,lbw b Santner 41 (64m 59b 4x4 1x6) SR: 69.49,MS Dhoni
"goes for a slog sweep, hitting against the turn with the ball tossed up and outside off. He top-edges it and the ball picks out midwicket with annoying precision for Pandey. Not the cleverest shot with Kohli at the other end, more so having secured a boundary earlier in the over. Was he trying to break the shackles on him after being beaten in the last ball?",195/4,290630,38.4,c Boult b Sodhi 0 (4m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Manish Pandey
"picks out long-off! He was placed wider, keeping in mind Kohli's ability to hit those inside out drives. That is the shot he goes for. Came down the track, took the ball on the half-volley and seemed to have struck it so well. The problem was it was straight at Guptill, who is perhaps New Zealand's best fielder. Kohli is livid as he walks off.",220/5,253802,43.1,c Guptill b Sodhi 65 (152m 76b 2x4 1x6) SR: 85.52,Virat Kohli
"inside edge onto the stumps. Boult has pulled off a very difficult delivery with relative ease. It was the offcutter, but it is put in the blockhole. Axar tries to slice the ball to third man with a horizontal bat, but ends up dragging on",266/6,554691,49.4, b Boult 24 (28m 18b 1x4 1x6) SR: 133.33,Axar Patel
