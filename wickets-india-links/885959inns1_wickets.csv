Vitori strikes.. Good length and in the channel outside off. Vijay is ordinarily good at leaving balls but he can't resist his temptation here. He pushes away from the body and edges it to Sibanda at second slip. Not a happy return to ODIs for Vijay,9/1,237095,3.2,c Sibanda b Vitori 1 (14m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.11,Murali Vijay
"sharp take from Masakadza at slip. On a length and outside off, Rahane is undone by extra bounce. Rahane chases as he aims to run it towards third man. He only manages a thick edge, which is snaffled by Masakadza, moving to his right and pouching it around chest height",60/2,277916,17.2,c Masakadza b Tiripano 34 (80m 49b 5x4 0x6) SR: 69.38,Ajinkya Rahane
"Chibhabha gets Tiwary, umpire Tiffin's finger goes up. Reward for probing bowling. Pitched up, smacks Tiwary on the front pad bang in front of middle. Again, Tiwary did not move his feet much as he attempted a defensive push. This would have rattled the leg stump",74/3,35565,20.4,lbw b Chibhabha 2 (14m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28,Manoj Tiwary
"a direct hit at the non-strikers' end and Uthappa is in trouble. They go to the TV umpire. Uthappa has to go, he bags a duck. He drops this full ball near short cover and calls for a risky single. Raza sprints to his right, swoops down on the ball and under-arm flicks it onto the furniture. Two wickets in two overs and India slip to 77 for 4",77/4,35582,21.3,run out (Sikandar Raza) 0 (6m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Robin Uthappa
"edged and Chibhabha has his second scalp. He is pleased as punch. Back of a length and outside off (not all that short), Jadhav is crease-bound as he aims to cut it away. However, he does not connect properly and nicks it behind. Umpire Tiffin raises his finger again; India are rattled",87/5,290716,24.2,c &dagger;Mutumbami b Chibhabha 5 (11m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.46,Kedar Jadhav
"Binny swings and edges it behind. Pushed full and wide outside off, Tiripano rolls his fingers across this cutter. Binny's balance is a mess as he looks to kitchen-sink it away. He can only manage an outside edge to Mutumbami. <i>End of a rapid stand, the highest sixth-wicket stand for India</i>",247/6,27223,48.5,c &dagger;Mutumbami b Tiripano 77 (92m 76b 6x4 2x6) SR: 101.31,Stuart Binny
