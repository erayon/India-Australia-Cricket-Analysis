"that's a ripper and he's been caught at slip! From around the wicket, Ashwin drifted the ball into the left-hander with teasing flight, he pitched the ball on middle, drawing de Kock into a forward defence with his length, the ball then spun sharply away, taking the outside edge and Raina took a low catch at slip",45/1,379143,8.4,c Raina b Ashwin 29 (37m 33b 5x4 0x6) SR: 87.87,Quinton de Kock
"bowled him! Mishra bowls the faster one that goes straight on, zipping through Amla's defences as he goes back to play the ball on the leg side. Clearly beaten by the change in pace. The ball deflects off the pad and hits the stumps",104/2,43906,23.2, b Mishra 37 (96m 59b 3x4 0x6) SR: 62.71,Hashim Amla
"lbw! Umesh returns and gets the ball to jag into the right-hander from outside off, the umpire had his finger up in a flash. That ball hit the pad before the bat and it looks pretty adjacent. Looks like there is some reverse swing on offer, du Plessis played the wrong line because of the sharp movement into him, he was looking to guide it to third man",152/3,44828,33.1,lbw b Yadav 62 (93m 77b 5x4 1x6) SR: 80.51,Faf du Plessis
"Miller's been stumped by a mile! He charged Mishra to try and hit him for six over the leg side but was beaten by the dipping legbreak that spun towards him and went through the gap between bat and body, Dhoni had so much time to break the stumps, Miller did not even try to make it back",197/4,321777,40.3,st &dagger;Dhoni b Mishra 13 (37m 22b 0x4 0x6) SR: 59.09,David Miller
"and once again he strikes first ball! Duminy chased a very wide ball with a slash - no footwork - and gets a thin edge through to Dhoni. Ordinary ball, ordinary shot, simple catch",238/5,44932,45.1,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 15 (21m 17b 0x4 1x6) SR: 88.23,Jean-Paul Duminy
