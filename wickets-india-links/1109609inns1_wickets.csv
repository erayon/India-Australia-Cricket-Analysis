"as far as return catches go, it can't get simpler than that. <b> Bhuvneshwar's first wicket of the series. </b> This is a knuckleball, the variation in pace does Dickwella in as he looks to flick but this one just stops on him and he ends up chipping it back to the bowler on his followthrough.",14/1,429754,2.6,c &amp; b Kumar 2 (m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Niroshan Dickwella
"<b> sensational from Kohli! </b> He was back-pedalling from mid-off but never lost sight of the ball. This was lofted as Munaweera made room to loft, but didn't get under the length properly - <b> this was another knuckleball </b> - which meant he didn't get the power he would've liked. Kohli timed his jump well, even with the momentum taking him back furiously, to pull it off.",40/2,304735,6.2,c Kohli b Kumar 4 (m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Dilshan Munaweera
"what a comeback! The party is over and this is a beauty that has nipped him out. This one pitched at length on leg stump, deviated just a wee bit to square Tharanga up completely as he looked to play towards the on side, only managed a thin edge as Dhoni gobbled up that straightforward offering.",63/3,50747,9.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Bumrah 48 (m 34b 9x4 0x6) SR: 141.17,Upul Tharanga
"played on! The highest fourth-wicket stand v India is over. The angle has done the trick for Bhuvi. This length ball nipped back in to cramp him for room as he tried to dab this to third man, but the ball came back in enough to sneak back in onto the stumps off the inside edge. Bhuvneshwar has his third.",185/4,301236,38.5, b Kumar 67 (m 102b 3x4 1x6) SR: 65.68,Lahiru Thirimanne
"what a soft dismissal that. Kuldeep has the last laugh and he's got the big wicket. Mathews gave away his intention of playing the lap sweep too early, so the bowler shortened his length just a little, this was also the wrong'un. Mathews still went through with it, only get a leading edge to Dhoni.",194/5,49764,41.1,c &dagger;Dhoni b Kuldeep Yadav 55 (m 98b 4x4 0x6) SR: 56.12,Angelo Mathews
"<b> dropped, bus still out. Wow </b> MS Dhoni has the presence of mind to quickly hare across and then pick the ball up and hurl a rocket throw at the bowler's end to run out Hasaranga. So five seconds after an opportunity goes down, Dhoni makes up for it. Neatly gathered by Chahal as well. Why would you run for it, Hasaranga? He shaped to cut, got  thick edge that fell out after hitting Dhoni's thigh and deflected to the leg side. Normally you wouldn't even call it a  chance. Anyway, Sri Lanka have lost two in quick succession. It could perhaps delay their slog.",205/6,784379,42.6,run out (&dagger;Dhoni/Chahal) 9 (m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Wanindu Hasaranga
"this is simply reward for persistence. Nice flight, this is a top-spinner that goes straight on as it dips on Dananjaya's forward defence after he skipped out. Dhoni effects his 100th stumping as the ball shaved past the inside edge. Couldn't have asked for an easier one to get there. What a collapse. Who would've thought they'd be scrapping for 230 when 270 was a given at one stage?",212/7,574178,44.6,st &dagger;Dhoni b Chahal 4 (m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 44.44,Akila Dananjaya
"cleaned him up. This is a poor old-fashioned slog. Bumrah slipped in a high full toss that dipped, the batsman's head fell over completely as he looked to swing this over midwicket. Off and middle stump took a royal knock.",228/8,50205,46.5, b Bumrah 8 (m 8b 0x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Malinda Pushpakumara
"Shardul redeems himself this time. High full toss on middle, he looks to whip this over square but skews it towards deep midwicket, where Thakur comes in quite some distance to complete the catch. He was on the move, but held his composure as he pouched that safely.",228/9,222354,47.2,c Thakur b Kumar 18 (m 13b 1x4 1x6) SR: 138.46,Milinda Siriwardana
"muscles this length ball straight to the throat of KL Rahul at deep midwicket. This was sitting up nicely for him to swing over the ropes, he hit it well but it was almost as if he forgot there was a fielder there. <b> First five-wicket haul for Bhuvneshwar Kumar in ODIs </b>",238/10,49758,49.4,c sub (KL Rahul) b Kumar 2 (m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Lasith Malinga
