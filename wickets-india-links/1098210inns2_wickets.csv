"gone! That's well bowled by Joseph, fullish outside off, but well short of driving length. Dhawan doesn't go for the full-blooded on-the-up drive. He holds himself back, perhaps realising too late that he's not to the pitch of the ball, and checks his shot, and only succeeds in spooning a simple catch to short cover",5/1,28235,0.6,c Lewis b Joseph 4 (m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33,Shikhar Dhawan
"plumb in front. He's played all around a straight one. For a moment, he was pondering a review but Kohli told him in no uncertain terms that the ball would've crashed into the stumps. This was angled in full from wide of the crease, Rahane was better off playing straight. Instead looked to work it wide of midwicket. Error in judgment.",84/2,277916,18.5,lbw b Bishoo 39 (m 51b 5x4 0x6) SR: 76.47,Ajinkya Rahane
