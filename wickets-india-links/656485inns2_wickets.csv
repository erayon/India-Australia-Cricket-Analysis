"Yadav has got his man as Tamim, chasing after this length delivery which just nips away, ends up catching the outside edge of Tamim's flashing blade, with Dhoni taking a good, low catch to his left to take it. Tamim is not convinced though as he wants the umpires to review whether this one indeed carried cleanly to the Indian captain. Shows the ball went in cleanly upon second viewing. Tamim has to go",33/1,56194,6.3,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 25 (28m 25b 4x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Tamim Iqbal
"Bangladesh falling apart here in the space of two balls as a huge <b>mix-up</b> between Soumya and Imrul has got the other opener back into the shed now. Soumya was guilty of ball-watching, along with Imrul, who backed up quite a bit before realising his partner had sold him down the river. Tries in vain to get back to his end at the non-striker's, but the fielder at short backward square was able to fire in a pinpoint throw at the right end as Yadav collected and flicked off the bails in time. Looks like it was Jadeja who had put in the fine work in the field",33/2,280734,6.4,run out (Jadeja/Yadav) 5 (31m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 35.71,Imrul Kayes
"it was a short ball, it was coming in at Mahmudullah who goes for an instinctive pull. But it seems to spew off the top edge. Yet it was travelling and seemed to lob the fielder at long leg, but Dhawan has pulled off a magnificent juggling act. Admittedly the ball popped out of his hands as he went for a reverse-cup catch. But he regrouped quickly, took the second attempt but that was when his left leg was about an inch away from disturbing the rope. He knew he has to toss the ball back into the field of play. Did that so very well and then wandered back in to pick up the catch",73/3,56025,16.6,c Dhawan b Mohammed Shami 21 (44m 31b 2x4 0x6) SR: 67.74,Mahmudullah
"how is that for a catch?! it's a rare sight to see Dhoni diving, but he has here and has plucked a one-handed screamer! Shami goes for another short ball bowled cross-seam, Sarkar looks for an encore of the ramp, but realises this is the slower bouncer. He does't have to pace to work with, he committed to the stroke too early and the ball simply runs off the open face. Dhoni moved to his left, dived full length and the ball somehow manages to find a seat in his left glove",90/4,436677,20.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Mohammed Shami 29 (59m 43b 3x4 1x6) SR: 67.44,Soumya Sarkar
"cut straight to short third man, couldn't have been an easier wicket! There was room, there was time, but there was short third man too! Shakib went on the back foot and sliced the ball from well outside off straight to Shami",104/5,56143,28.2,c Mohammed Shami b Jadeja 10 (36m 34b 0x4 0x6) SR: 29.41,Shakib Al Hasan
"it had to happen! Beware the batting Powerplay. The short ball skids onto him far too quickly for his pull, takes a leading edge while he was only midway through the stroke and simply shot straight up. Dhoni says it's mine, spreads his arms out to make sure everyone knew it and pouches it cleanly.",139/6,56029,35.1,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 27 (50m 43b 2x4 0x6) SR: 62.79,Mushfiqur Rahim
"loops the ball up to tempt the drive, out it comes but Nasir has failed to keep it down. Nor did he place it. Picks out Ashwin at short cover. Time for the tail, time for some fun",189/7,300618,42.6,c Ashwin b Jadeja 35 (29m 34b 6x4 0x6) SR: 102.94,Nasir Hossain
"they've got another, Dhoni's got another! It was full and a shade outside off, Mashrafe hurts himself by staying put outside leg stump and poking at the ball. It almost runs off the face to the keeper",192/8,56007,43.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b MM Sharma 1 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Mashrafe Mortaza
"short ball consumes Rubel as Kohli shakes his head, almost sadly. Too quick for him, too straight for him to free the arms and the top edge is safely pouched at square leg",193/9,300619,44.4,c Ashwin b Yadav 0 (2m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Rubel Hossain
"nearly popped out, but the second grab does it. India are into the  semi-finals with the 100th win under MS Dhoni. Had to be a short ball to sign things off and the top-edged pull flies to long leg. The fielder got under it, but might have been a touch nervous. Hard hands meant he nearly spilled it, but he was alert enough to grab the rebound",193/10,373538,44.6,c Mohammed Shami b Yadav 30 (68m 40b 2x4 0x6) SR: 75.00,Sabbir Rahman
