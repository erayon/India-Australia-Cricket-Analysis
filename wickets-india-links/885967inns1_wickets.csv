"Soft, soft dismissal for Rahane. The umpires check for a possible no-ball. Madziva's footing is okay. Good length and outside off, sort of stops on Rahane, who is early into an attempted airy drive. He can only slice it into the hands of Utseya at cover-point",25/1,277916,5.5,c Utseya b Madziva 15 (28m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 68.18,Ajinkya Rahane
"Vijay has nicked off. Looked like a cross-seam ball outside off with some extra bounce. Vijay drives in the channel,  plays away from the body, with his feet nailed to the crease. He can only feed an outside edge to Mutumbami",33/2,237095,7.1,c &dagger;Mutumbami b Madziva 13 (37m 21b 2x4 0x6) SR: 61.90,Murali Vijay
"innocuous straight ball and Tiwary has chipped it back. The dot-ball pressure tells. He seeks to work it to the leg side, gets a leading edge back to Utseya...",68/3,35565,18.2,c &amp; b Utseya 10 (47m 33b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.30,Manoj Tiwary
"Uthappa now gives it away. Good length and holds its line around off, much like Tiwary, Uthappa attempts a leg-side flick. He does not get hold of it. Skewered to mid-off via a leading edge. Chigumbura moves back and takes it even as he loses balance and tumbles onto the ground..",82/4,35582,21.4,c Chigumbura b Masakadza 31 (68m 44b 3x4 0x6) SR: 70.45,Robin Uthappa
"Manish holes out to long-on. Chibhabha sucks pace off this outside off. Manish has to drag the pull from there and hits it to long-on, where Raza takes a smart catch, diving forward. Chibhabha's footing is fine and Manish walks back for 71 off 86 balls on debut",226/5,290630,46.5,c Sikandar Raza b Chibhabha 71 (104m 86b 4x4 1x6) SR: 82.55,Manish Pandey
