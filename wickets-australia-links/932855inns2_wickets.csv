"and the encore fails! Hazlewood gets the breakthrough. Good length and wider outside off. He goes across the line again. Last ball he hit it to the left of the fielder, played it finer. Now he shovels it and holes out to deep square leg. Faulkner completes the catch",35/1,379143,7.2,c Faulkner b Hazlewood 19 (33m 29b 3x4 0x6) SR: 65.51,Quinton de Kock
"got im. Amla goes. He has picked out cover to perfection. Overpitched again outside off from Hazlewood, Amla leans on the drive and smashes it straight to Smith at cover who leans forward and takes the catch a few inches off the ground",140/2,43906,25.4,c Smith b Hazlewood 60 (105m 64b 6x4 1x6) SR: 93.75,Hashim Amla
"and he gets the wicket straightaway. Big, big wicket. Full and wide outside off, Faf reaches out for it and can't control the drive. It's in the air and taken at backward point. Huge wicket. Just got a hint of away movement there on that, which was responsible for Faf struggling to control the ball",177/3,44828,31.1,c Bailey b Starc 63 (95m 76b 5x4 0x6) SR: 82.89,Faf du Plessis
"massive blow! AB is bowled. Good length and (reverse)swings back in, AB swings and Hazlewood rides his car through the gate and parks it on top of the middle stump. Then he <a href=""http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/image/1025609.html?object=207428;dir=next"" target=""_blank"">roars like this</a>. Mid-off was up and AB was targetting to pump it over that man",210/4,44936,37.5, b Hazlewood 39 (59m 32b 4x4 1x6) SR: 121.87,AB de Villiers
"FB has been given out lbw by umpire Llong. FB wants a review after consulting with his senior partner. Impact: pad first. This just skids off the deck in line with middle and raps the front pad before FB managed a tickle, pressing forward. The tracker shows that it would have gone onto hit the leg stump. Umpire Llong's decision is vindicated. SA falling away",221/5,44410,40.3,lbw b Zampa 4 (15m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Farhaan Behardien
"Zampa dangles another wrong'un and takes down Duminy. Floated on middle, he goes for the slog sweep again, this time holing out to deep midwicket. Duminy goes and with it SA's hopes? Maxi, the sub, completed the waist-high catch",236/6,44932,42.4,c sub (GJ Maxwell) b Zampa 41 (59m 39b 4x4 1x6) SR: 105.12,Jean-Paul Duminy
the off stump is sent cartwheeling. Nails it full and finds some awayswing. Enough to beat the outside edge of this lazy poke and take out the off stump. Abbott was left squared up,237/7,297583,43.2, b Starc 1 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Kyle Abbott
"tossed on leg, Parnell steps out and has an almighty swing at it, only to toe-end a catch to long-on. Marsh completes a shoulder-high catch. Zampa has his third wicket",239/8,265564,44.3,c Marsh b Zampa 3 (18m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.00,Wayne Parnell
Maxi takes a screamer at backward point. Plucks it out of thin air. Angled in full and tails away late outside off  at 146ks to mess with the drive. He slices it in the air. Maxi leaps and stretches his right hand over his head. He comes out with the ball in one hand. <strong>One-handed stunner</strong>! The timing of the jump was impressive,240/9,46942,45.1,c sub (GJ Maxwell) b Starc 3 (8m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.00,Aaron Phangiso
"<strong>Australia win</strong>! back of a length and angled in, helped down to deep fine leg. They aim for the second. There is a direct hit at the non-striker's end from wicketkeeper Wade after collecting the throw from Khawaja in the deep. Redemption for the missed stumping? Tahir's bat is in the air as the bails get dislodged. All over",252/10,40618,47.4,run out (Khawaja/&dagger;Wade) 6 (16m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Imran Tahir
