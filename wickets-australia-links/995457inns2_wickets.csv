"<b>Perera earns the outside edge, Perera catches it</b>! Warner swipes the turf as he walks back. Nice and full on middle, seams away, looked like Warner shaped to run it down to third man. Does not get enough bat on it. Edges it behind to the keeper. That should taste su-weet for Thisara after being smashed for over 100 in his last List A outing. There was no slip, which tempted Warner",40/1,219889,7.2,c &dagger;MDKJ Perera b NLTC Perera 8 (29m 17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 47.05,David Warner
"another appeal for caught behind. Not given. <b>Umpire Dar's review</b>. Mathews collected it cleanly. The on-field umpires want to check whether it was a bump ball. Certainly not. TV umpire Gough looks for the nick. There was a noise. It could have come from the bat thudding the ground. No visible deflection. No conclusive evidence, yet. Tight, tight call for Gough. He looks at various replays and rules Finch out. Nice, low take from Mathews. Finch looks disgruntled. Smith chats with the umpires. <b>Aponso has his maiden international scalp</b>. This pitched just outside off and spun sharply at Finch. He flung his bat down and gave an edge to slip. Hmm, not sure if there was an edge, though",79/2,5334,14.2,c Mathews b Aponso 56 (58m 46b 7x4 2x6) SR: 121.73,Aaron Finch
"<b>Maiden ODI wicket for Sandakan</b>. No turn. Sandakan just throws this up outside off, Wade turns to his favourite sweep. He unfurls the slog sweep now. Middles it straight into the lap of Dilshan at short midwicket. The old fella nonchalantly plucks the catch",128/3,230193,24.6,c Dilshan b Sandakan 26 (42m 34b 0x4 0x6) SR: 76.47,Matthew Wade
"superb work at short leg! That was hit off the middle, more so off the middle after Smith had run down the track. Danushka Gunathilaka, the sub, reached to his left, popped the ball up and took it on the rebound all cool-like. Top innings from Smith, but he screams to the heavens for falling so close to the end of the chase.",190/4,267192,37.5,c sub (MD Gunathilaka) b MDK Perera 58 (124m 92b 5x4 0x6) SR: 63.04,Steven Smith
"pops it straight to short leg! Do Sri Lanka have a chance here? Henriques went back to flick the ball - a shortish one - and he directs it to the fielder under the helmet more for an inside edge off the pad, but Gunathilaka keeps plucking catches off shots hit off the middle",202/5,5961,40.1,c sub (MD Gunathilaka) b Sandakan 6 (12m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 85.71,Moises Henriques
"he's helped a short ball, down leg, down the throat of long leg! Bailey walks off looking shell-shocked. He could have had his pick of the ground - and this is a seriously large one - to belt the ball away, instead he gets a top edge and Sandakan takes an easy catch",216/6,4451,43.3,c Sandakan b MDK Perera 39 (76m 54b 3x4 0x6) SR: 72.22,George Bailey
"Kusal is certain he's stumped Head! And it appears his back foot is in the air even as he tried to push back to safety! Beautiful bowling from Dilruwan, tossed it up just outside off, tempted the batsman forward to defend with hard, searching hands. Just delight for an offspinner to get a man out like that, not to mention the rapid work from the keeper. Kusal is doing a rip-roaring job",222/7,530011,45.3,st &dagger;MDKJ Perera b MDK Perera 10 (23m 17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 58.82,Travis Head
