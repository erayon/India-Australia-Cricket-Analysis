"breakthrough! Hales picks out midwicket. A short ball from Marsh, Hales latches on but pinged it straight to Watson. A bit of a giveaway from Hales.",70/1,249866,11.2,c Watson b Marsh 22 (44m 22b 3x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Alex Hales
"steps away and drives, in the air... and taken at point! Maxwell has got Roy, slicing a shot straight to the fielder. Might have skidded on a bit as he was trying to force the ball over the off side - maybe an unnecessary risk, with singles coming regularly, but that's the game and Roy's a goner",112/2,298438,17.5,c Warner b Maxwell 67 (71m 64b 11x4 0x6) SR: 104.68,Jason Roy
"angling in, swipes across the line - and bowled 'im! Taylor advanced at the bowler again, played around a straight one and it clattered into the top of middle and leg. He falls for an industrious 49 and the pressure goes up another notch",152/3,297635,26.2, b Watson 49 (62m 51b 4x4 1x6) SR: 96.07,James Taylor
"he finds midwicket! Not Stokes' most convincing innings. A full delivery, angled into the pads, and he flicks it straight to Joe Burns...silence around the ground",172/4,311158,32.1,c Burns b Starc 13 (24m 23b 1x4 0x6) SR: 56.52,Ben Stokes
"huge moment! He's gloved it down the leg side going for the pull. The ball was there for the shot, short and outside leg stump, but it just glanced the glove through to Wade",194/5,24598,35.5,c &dagger;Wade b Watson 38 (78m 46b 4x4 0x6) SR: 82.60,Eoin Morgan
"but he's gone now! England falling away. Full outside off, Buttler goes for the drive and just picks out mid-off inside the circle. That was loose from Buttler, needed to at least take a moment to assess after Morgan's departure",194/6,308967,36.1,c Marsh b Coulter-Nile 4 (21m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Jos Buttler
"he's on a hat-trick! Short, angled down the leg side, Woakes goes for a paddle-turned-pull and gets a very thin glove through to Wade. One glove down the leg side can be unlucky, but two in four balls?",194/7,247235,36.2,c &dagger;Wade b Coulter-Nile 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Chris Woakes
"regulation stuff, full outside off, nicked to the keeper...Starc came round the wicket and there's just a hint of it moving away from Rashid as he drives. Neat, low catch",220/8,244497,40.1,c &dagger;Wade b Starc 11 (16m 11b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Adil Rashid
"and that's just about that! The short ball does the trick. Got fed up feeding Moeen's drive, went short and it's worked. Moeen goes for the pull, comes off the toe end, goes high but not very far and midwicket settles underneath it",232/9,8917,41.6,c Marsh b Cummins 17 (30m 18b 3x4 0x6) SR: 94.44,Moeen Ali
that's all over! Finn misses a wild swing to leg and Cummins was straight. Job done.,246/10,210283,45.3, b Cummins 10 (13m 17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 58.82,Steven Finn
