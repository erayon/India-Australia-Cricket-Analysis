"84.6mph lifter, prancing delivery. Warner leaps of his feet and looks to fend it to leg. Instead, he pops it over the keeper's head",2/0,219889,0.2,retired hurt 1 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,David Warner
"The middle stump is tiled back. Finn shoots through Burns' gate. He has been pretty good with the drive but fails this time. This was full and curves in, Burns sets up for a drive and does not connect. Finn rips through the bat-pad gap and that's timbaaaah!",42/1,326632,8.5, b Finn 22 (40m 26b 4x4 0x6) SR: 84.61,Joe Burns
"and the change works. Maybe a loss in concentration by Bailey but that turned a mile. Beautiful drift by Moeen. Tossed up outside off with plenty of drift, pitches outside off and spins in to beat Bailey's flaying bat and take leg stump. Not only an offspinner's dream ball but a very vital wicket too.",141/2,4451,28.2, b Ali 54 (78m 72b 5x4 0x6) SR: 75.00,George Bailey
"oh, he's gone this time. Tame dismissal for Smith. He is distraught, nothing wicket for Rashid. Tossed up nicely outside off and Smith looks to drive through cover but the ball skews to point off the outer half of the bat",171/3,267192,33.3,c Taylor b Rashid 70 (133m 87b 7x4 0x6) SR: 80.45,Steven Smith
"No fifty for Maxwell. Umpire Dharmasena's finger goes up. Maxwell has a chat with Watson and decides not to review. Nice and full and on middle, Maxwell shuffles across and topples over the flick as he is rapped on the front pad.

"Watson missed a kick in the T20I, he was a victim of a poor call and was run-out in the first ODI, he has holed off a low full toss in this game. Watson did not get under this properly and hit it straight down the throat of long-on. Stokes fires in a wicked stare...",281/5,8180,46.6,c Plunkett b Stokes 39 (55m 38b 1x4 2x6) SR: 102.63,Shane Watson
"short, lifting ball outside off. Wade is hurried onto a pull, he skews it in the air off a top edge, which is swallowed by Stokes himself. Simple return catch. The batsmen cross over and Marsh will be on strike",295/6,230193,48.1,c &amp; b Stokes 1 (6m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Matthew Wade
"Marsh pops it behind off the last ball of the innings. Short, slower ball down the leg side at 110.4ks. Marsh was far too early into the pull and could only glove it to Buttler.
