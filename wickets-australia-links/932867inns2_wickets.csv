"Here comes Fletcher, down the track.... Here goes Fletcher. The opener's miserable stay ends. This is an easier chance for the Australian captain. Fletcher, perhaps, showed his ace early by galloping out. Hazlewood shortened his length on off and found some extra bounce. Takes the edge near the higher part of the bat and carries to slip. Overhead catch",49/1,51862,10.3,c Smith b Hazlewood 9 (46m 25b 1x4 0x6) SR: 36.00,Andre Fletcher
"runs were coming in a trickle, and the pressure has got to Bravo. Marsh angles a short of length delivery back in from around the stumps, Bravo is cramped for room as he looks to run it down to third man, and can only manage a faint nick through to Matthew Wade. Straightforward decision for the umpire, but Bravo started to walk even before he raised the finger. Trouble for West Indies",62/2,277472,16.2,c &dagger;Wade b Marsh 6 (24m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 30.00,Darren Bravo
"soft dismissal, Mitch Marsh has another. Failure again for Samuels! This one's a slower delivery on the stumps, there's a hint of grip off the surface, it cuts away a touch as well, Samuels gets a leading edge to Bailey at short cover as he closes the bat face early. Real trouble now for the hosts",68/3,52983,18.1,c Bailey b Marsh 6 (8m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 85.71,Marlon Samuels
"third one for Mitch Marsh. Johnson Charles is plays all around a straight delivery angled in to middle and leg and is plumb in front. Errs in judgment and has to walk back. For a moment, Charles thought about the review, but it would have been a futile exercise. The wheels are coming off West Indies' chase here.",72/4,333066,20.1,lbw b Marsh 45 (88m 61b 4x4 1x6) SR: 73.77,Johnson Charles
"Pollard tries to clear long-off. Instead, he finds the fielder. Zamps loops this legbreak outside off, and draws the big hit from KP. He goes with the turn and slices a lofted hit to Hazlewood, tumbling to his left at the edge of the boundary. Smart, smart catch. Hazlewood hung on even as the ball bobbled out",105/5,230559,27.1,c Hazlewood b Zampa 20 (33m 25b 1x4 1x6) SR: 80.00,Kieron Pollard
"Holder steps out again, the scoreboard pressure tells. He gives a catch to sweeper cover. Finch reverse-cups the ball over his head. Good length and outside off, Holder could only miscue the lofted hit",148/6,391485,37.4,c Finch b Coulter-Nile 34 (43m 37b 3x4 1x6) SR: 91.89,Jason Holder
"cleaned em' up! Back of a length on middle, Carlos winds up and aims to slug it across the line. He misses it and Hazlewood nails the top of middle and roars. Carlos gone and with it WI's hopes?",185/7,457249,41.3, b Hazlewood 14 (18m 11b 1x4 1x6) SR: 127.27,Carlos Brathwaite
"The middle stump is tilted back. Hazlewood hastening WI's slide. Good length on middle, Ramdin backs away outside leg and does not touch it. Timbaaaah! He couldn't connect with a leg-side slog",194/8,52917,43.3, b Hazlewood 40 (115m 67b 2x4 1x6) SR: 59.70,Denesh Ramdin
"he's picked the bones out of that, but couldn't have picked out the man better. Steven Smith at the edge of the circle at cover had a thunderbolt coming his way, but he held on to it. Narine cleared his front leg to clatter that, but to no avail. Australia one wicket away from the cup!",211/9,230558,45.2,c Smith b Hazlewood 23 (19m 18b 4x4 0x6) SR: 127.77,Sunil Narine
"has he made clean connection? For most parts, it was six, until Glenn Maxwell leapt high, kept his eyes on the ball and then pulled off a stunner while he was air borne. All along, he was mindful of the ropes behind him as he timed his jump to perfection. <b> Five wickets for Hazlewood, Australia are winners of the tri-series </b>",212/10,51248,45.4,c Maxwell b Hazlewood 2 (11m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Sulieman Benn
