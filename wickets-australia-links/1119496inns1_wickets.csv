"Australia find reward for their tight lines and lengths with the new ball. Coulter-Nile puts it on a length and wide outside off, swings away further - it ended on a set of stumps outside off. Rahane throws his bat at a drive and only snicks it behind. Wade, who has been busy this afternoon, moves to his right and snags the catch. Rahane falls for 5 off 15 balls on return",11/1,277916,3.3,c &dagger;Wade b Coulter-Nile 5 (m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Ajinkya Rahane
"Kohli can't get away. Maxwell at backward point pulls off a belting one-handed catch over his head. Kohli has been dismissed for a four-ball duck. This was full and wide - wider than a set of stumps outside off again. Kohli had left his first ball. He chased the second one with a big drive. The big drive comes out again, he slices it into the air. Maxwell propels himself at backward point, sticks out his right hand, and grabs the ball, and lands. Great reflexes from Maxwell",11/2,253802,5.1,c Maxwell b Coulter-Nile 0 (m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Virat Kohli
"Is Pandey out nicking behind as well? Australia are sure they have their man and keep celebrating... but umpire Erasmus asks them to hold on. Was it a bump ball? He refers it to the TV umpire. Very, very full and swinging away so very late outside off, Pandey jams his bat down on the ground. The ball did not touch the ground, though; takes the outside edge and floats into the gloves of Wade. Clean catch. India left at 11 for 3 in 5.3. All three batsmen out flirting in the channel",11/3,290630,5.3,c &dagger;Wade b Coulter-Nile 0 (m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Manish Pandey
"<b>holes out to deep square leg.</b> An ordinary shot. Stoinis has been easily picked off with short bowling. But this one is 5 kph quicker than the last ball. Rohit goes for the hook, but the ball is way outside off. It's a regulation top edge and a regulation reverse-cup for Coulter-Nile. Umpires check for no-ball, but the crowd has already begun shouting <b>Dhoni! Dhoni!</b>",64/4,34102,15.6,c Coulter-Nile b Stoinis 28 (m 44b 3x4 0x6) SR: 63.63,Rohit Sharma
"<b>caught at midwicket.</b> Short one at off stump. Once again, a batsman looks to drag Stoinis' short one into the leg side. Once again, slow on it. This one is bunted off the high part of the bat. An easy catch",87/5,290716,21.3,c Cartwright b Stoinis 40 (m 54b 5x4 0x6) SR: 74.07,Kedar Jadhav
"Zampa has his revenge. Pushed through flatter and faster on middle, 92ks, no flight at all. Pandya goes low for a slog-sweep against the break, aiming wide long-on again. All he can manage now is a top edge that swirls to short third man. Ends a crackling innings - one that has given India a fighting chance. He goes for a career-best 83",205/6,625371,40.5,c Faulkner b Zampa 83 (m 66b 5x4 5x6) SR: 125.75,Hardik Pandya
"Dhoni forays down the track again... this time holes out to long-off. Faulkner's front foot is fine. Faulker pulled his length back, seeing Dhoni step out, on off stump. Dhoni gets it high on the bat and splices it to Warner for a head-high catch",277/7,28081,49.4,c Warner b Faulkner 79 (m 88b 4x4 2x6) SR: 89.77,MS Dhoni
