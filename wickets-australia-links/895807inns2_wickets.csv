"sharp return catch! <strong>Maiden international wicket for Sran</strong> in his second over. He is mobbed by his team-mates. Subdued celebrations overall. Sran lands it full and outside off at 136.5ks, Finch wants to drill a drive, but the bat twists in his hand. He hits it back to the bowler. Sran gets both hands to his right and hangs onto the catch",9/1,5334,2.3,c &amp; b Sran 8 (11m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 72.72,Aaron Finch
"make that two in two overs for Sran! He roars and pumps his fist as Warner exits. This was no subdued celebration. Full and outside off again, at 137,2ks, this time to the left hander. Warner looks to loft it over mid-off. He does not get hold of it; Kohli completes the overhead catch",21/2,219889,4.4,c Kohli b Sran 5 (20m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,David Warner
"And Ashwin has broken past the pair. Tossed up and outside off, Bailey dances out and lifts it... Bhuvneshwar runs across to his right from long-off, goes for the catch with both hands. The ball bobbles out but he manages to secure it on the rebound. Bailey acknowledges the cheers as he walks back",263/3,4451,41.5,c Kumar b Ashwin 112 (137m 120b 7x4 2x6) SR: 93.33,George Bailey
"Maxi skips out to his tossed-up ball. He heaves it in the air. Dhawan runs to his right from long-on and settles under it. Good catch, that. Ashwin has another. Perhaps it's all to little and too late for India",273/4,325026,43.4,c Dhawan b Ashwin 6 (7m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Glenn Maxwell
Smith falls one short of 150. Sran tricks Smith with a slower ball outside off. He is early into the drive and spoons it into the lap of Kohli at short cover,308/5,267192,49.1,c Kohli b Sran 149 (179m 135b 11x4 2x6) SR: 110.37,Steven Smith
