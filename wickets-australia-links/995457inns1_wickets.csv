"bowled'em! <strong>Wicket no.99 for Starc</strong>. Lurking behind Saqlain. 141ks, Pretty full again, this time the line is bang on target. On the off stump, angled in. Perera hacks across the line and can't touch it. Starc bursts through the gate and barges into Kusal's castle. Success in his first over for the visitors. The off stump is knocked out. What a sight for a fast bowler!",3/1,300631,0.4, b Starc 1 (5m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Kusal Perera
"The Dilscoop goes awry for Dilshan. Not a happy return for the old pro. Henriques finds some extra bounce outside off, which foils Dilshan's shot. And the ball isn't coming on here. He top-edges it, <b>hit the helmet</b>, and ballooned in the air. Smith runs in from point and settles under the catch",45/2,48472,11.1,c Smith b Henriques 22 (52m 27b 2x4 0x6) SR: 81.48,Tillakaratne Dilshan
"got 'im! One mistake too many for Mendis as he pulls too early, gets a top edge and offers a dolly of a catch - for once where the fielder was. Head at midwicket takes it and Australia celebrate, giving thanks to Faulkner's offcutter slower ball holding in the pitch",124/3,629074,29.1,c Head b Faulkner 67 (124m 95b 6x4 0x6) SR: 70.52,Kusal Mendis
"double-wicket over, and Head should deserves a lot of credit for this one. Takes an <b>outstanding catch</b> at point! Faulkner tempts the drive with a wide half-volley, Mathews takes the bait but should have gone after it harder. Head at point moves nimbly to his left, leaps up and takes it with both hands over his head",124/4,49764,29.5,c Head b Faulkner 0 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Angelo Mathews
"<b>100 ODI wickets, and he is the fastest ever to that mark in cricket history</b>! Big, tall, scary fast bowler makes history with a innocuous, pace-less, slow old teaser. Ah, irony. Starc had de Silva reaching outside off, thinking it was up there for a cover drive, but the ball holds in the pitch and pops over to short midwicket. Bailey moves to his right, dives and secures it. Brilliant piece of deception from Starc, and sign that he is evolving.",132/5,465793,32.2,c Bailey b Starc 2 (15m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Dhananjaya de Silva
"good length and outside off, Siriwardana's bottom hand flies off the bat as he chips a catch to mid-off, running to his right. The ball stopped at Siriwardana, who checked his loft hit and simply lobbed a catch to Finch. Stroke making is very difficult on this parched surface",173/6,222354,42.4,c Finch b Starc 19 (50m 26b 0x4 0x6) SR: 73.07,Milinda Siriwardana
"<b>that is one heck of a catch from Wade running forward!</b> But the fourth umpire has asked Thisara to wait, the third umpire will be taking a look at this. Thisara was wandering outside off stump for the scoop, Faulkner bowls it shorter and wider to complicate the shot. Desitined to be mistimed and Wade, with excellent presence of mind runs across, and boy is he quick! Had the ball in his sights all through, throws himself after the ball - he needed to, wouldn't have reached it otherwise - and catches it with his arms fully outstretched millimeters off the ground. Replays indicated the ball bounced up, and it did, but it was off Wade's gloves, not the ground. Umpire Gough did well to call that",209/7,233514,47.4,c &dagger;Wade b Faulkner 21 (29m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 150.00,Thisara Perera
"goes for the lap sweep.... and picks out short fine leg! If he was intending to use the pace of the ball, there was very little on it. A 116 kph fuller ball on leg stump gives Faulkner his fourth",224/8,49920,49.2,c Hazlewood b Faulkner 10 (8m 6b 2x4 0x6) SR: 166.66,Dilruwan Perera
