"bowled him! McCullum falls after kickstarting New Zealand's innings. Faulkner delivered a perfect yorker from around the wicket, McCullum stayed back and tried to drive it through the off side, instead of defending. He missed and Faulkner hit. Eden Park rises to applaud their captain as he leaves after his final international innings on this ground",79/1,37737,10.5, b Faulkner 44 (46m 29b 5x4 3x6) SR: 151.72,Brendon McCullum
"Williamson has fallen for a duck, very rarely does one get to type those words! He drove at a good length ball that stopped on him a touch, and ended up hitting it on the up and away from his body, there was a fielder at short cover and Shaun Marsh caught it",81/2,277906,12.4,c SE Marsh b Hazlewood 0 (8m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Kane Williamson
"Guptill's been run out! Maxwell scores a direct hit. Nicholls was hit on the pad and the ball rolled off it towards short cover, Guptill ran for the single but Nicholls wasn't responding. It was really too risky. Maxwell swooped on the ball from cover and hit the stumps at the bowler's end. Guptill short by a long way despite a full length dive. Nicholls was a little late in saying no but there was really no run there.",181/3,226492,24.5,run out (Maxwell) 90 (107m 76b 8x4 5x6) SR: 118.42,Martin Guptill
"he's timed his ball miserably and been caught just outside the inner circle at mid-off by Hastings. Elliott came forward and outside leg to loft inside out over cover. The ball pitched short of a length and he ended up toe-ending it tamely in the air, Hastings only had to move a little to his left to take the simple catch",205/4,44956,29.3,c Hastings b MR Marsh 21 (21m 18b 2x4 1x6) SR: 116.66,Grant Elliott
"that is poor shot selection, the length was not short enough to pull and Nicholls is hurried for time and he top edges the ball high in the air straight to Wade behind the stumps. He tried to drag it from outide off stump too. He's played a fine innings though",231/5,539511,35.2,c &dagger;Wade b MR Marsh 61 (102m 67b 6x4 1x6) SR: 91.04,Henry Nicholls
"such a soft dismissal! New Zealand's wheels are coming off. Anderson timed the front foot drive well, hitting it on the up and firmly too, just that he hit it flat, in the air, and straight to Richardson, who barely had to move at cover",234/6,277662,36.5,c Richardson b Hastings 10 (34m 20b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Corey Anderson
bowled him! Ronchi's struggle is over. Hazlewood nails him with a yorker on off and middle stump. Ronchi swiped across the line and missed and his stumps took a beating,263/7,7502,44.4, b Hazlewood 16 (36m 26b 2x4 0x6) SR: 61.53,Luke Ronchi
"that is a stunning reflex catch from Faulkner! Milne cleared his front foot and smashed the full ball hard and to Faulkner's left at shoulder height. Faulkner stuck his left hand out in his follow through and parried the ball up and caught it on the second try. He barely celebrates the dismissal, so nonchalant. Milne actually mis-timed it but it was still struck hard",290/8,450860,47.4,c &amp; b Faulkner 14 (12m 10b 1x4 1x6) SR: 140.00,Adam Milne
