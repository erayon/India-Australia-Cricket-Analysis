"bowled. There is Starc's customary first-over wicket. What a delivery again. Fuller than a good length - the ideal length. Gunathilaka is neither forward nor back, so he tentatively pokes at the length. Since there is no swing, the ball carries on towards the inside edge, kisses that edge and rattles into middle stump. Beaten by the length actually of that",6/1,345821,0.6, b Starc 5 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Danushka Gunathilaka
"got 'im this time. A superb comeback from Hazlewood. Drags his length back this time, close to off. Mendis has to defend, and although the ball doesn't move, it still takes Mendis' outside edge. Carries low to Warner at second slip who dives in front and completes a quality catch. SL in some trouble",23/2,629074,3.2,c Warner b Hazlewood 4 (12m 2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200.00,Kusal Mendis
"he's gone off a <strong>full toss</strong> and that's that for Dilshan's ODI career! He came down the track and chipped the low full toss to midwicker where Bailey had to jump a little to catch it over his head. A few handhakes from some of the Australian fielders, a pat from Chandimal and Dilshan immediately takes his helmet off and walks off with his arms aloft for the crowd. A standing ovation from the spectators, emotional scenes there",96/3,48472,18.6,c Bailey b Zampa 42 (84m 65b 5x4 0x6) SR: 64.61,Tillakaratne Dilshan
"loud appeal for lbw and Aleem Dar has raised the finger, it wasn't plumb, and Mathews <b>reviews</b>. It wasn't as flighted, pitched somewhere around leg stump, replays will confirm that, and straightened to beat Mathews' inside edge before hitting him in front of leg. Here comes ball tracking - pitches in line, straightens enough to hit him in line and is hitting the stumps. Mathews has to go, Zampa at it again",103/4,49764,20.2,lbw b Zampa 2 (12m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Angelo Mathews
"he tries to accelerate and hands a catch to mid-on, good work there by Shaun Marsh! Came down the track and took the ball on the full, stroking the ball in the air and Marsh dived to his left after a few steps to grab it with both hands",133/5,465793,29.4,c Marsh b Faulkner 12 (39m 30b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Dhananjaya de Silva
"too good! Another swinging yorker does for Kusal. Tailed in on leg, Kusal misses his flick and the ball hits leg stump. Some discernible late movement back in. May have ricocheted off the pads, and then into the stumps",154/6,300631,35.5, b Starc 11 (32m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.00,Kusal Perera
"taken! What was that from Perera. Pace off the ball from Hastings, Perera went through with his wild hoick and only succeeded in slogging it into the hands of deep square leg. Lovely bowling, wily change in pace.",165/7,233514,38.1,c Marsh b Hastings 9 (12m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 90.00,Thisara Perera
"picks out deep midwicket. Filthy half-tracker on off, Prasanna rocks back and nails his pull, but straight to Bailey who sets himself under and takes it. Not the way Zampa would have wanted to get  that",178/8,268740,40.6,c Bailey b Zampa 3 (12m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85,Seekkuge Prasanna
"gone this time. A short delivery on off, bouncer. Dilruwan stays in his crease and checks his pull straight to Warner at midwicket. Didn't keep it down, didn't go after it. Lobbed a catch instead",217/9,49920,47.5,c Warner b Hastings 17 (33m 21b 1x4 1x6) SR: 80.95,Dilruwan Perera
"nice catch from Zampa at long-on to end the innings. A slower ball on off, Chandimal comes down and swings through the line, the ball goes up, stays up for quite a while, but Zampa sets himself under it at long-on and takes a good catch.",226/10,300628,49.2,c Zampa b Faulkner 102 (213m 130b 7x4 0x6) SR: 78.46,Dinesh Chandimal
