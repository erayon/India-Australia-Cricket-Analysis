"massive appeal, umpire Dar says no, <strong>Chandimal chooses to review</strong>. Looks very close to the glove. Yes, definitely glove I'd say. Flat delivery on off, Wade got low and looked to sweep. The wicketkeeper got across and collected the opportunity. The decision is overturned, enough evidence as the glove brushed the ball. Good take.",11/1,230193,3.2,c &dagger;MDKJ Perera b MDK Perera 3 (17m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.07,Matthew Wade
"gone! Khawaja is beaten in pace and flight. The crowd goes wild. Tossed up outside off, Khawaja runs down and looks to flick through midwicket, but the ball spins and takes his leading edge as the face of the bat closes. Takes the edge and carries to cover point. A beautiful dismissal, not a great shot either. Did not get to the pitch, didn't adjust",25/2,215155,5.5,c Gunathilaka b MDK Perera 6 (11m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Usman Khawaja
"a strong appeal, the finger goes up and the crowd has been shaken alive. But hang on, Bailey has <strong>reviewed it</strong>! It was pretty full around leg, Bailey swept and missed and took it low on his front pad. Looks like there's no edge, all depends on where the ball pitched. Here comes ball-tracking - it has pitched in line, hit in line and 'umpire's call' for hitting the stumps. So umpire Palliyaguruge's decision stays",157/3,4451,32.4,lbw b MDK Perera 44 (110m 73b 2x4 0x6) SR: 60.27,George Bailey
"oh no. He has picked out long-on. Muttering away under his breath. What a waste of a wicket. A full toss on middle, Head runs to the ball and drills it straight to the fielder. The  bat face may have just turned in his hands causing him to pick out the fielder",179/4,530011,38.1,c Lakmal b de Silva 13 (21m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 65.00,Travis Head
"throws his head back in disgust. Warner is not happy at all. He has just hit back a nothing delivery to the bowler. End of a superlative knock though. Lots of flight outside off, Warner looks to drive through cover but the ball is too full, he ends up skewing the ball back off the inside half.",189/5,219889,40.6,c &amp; b de Silva 106 (167m 126b 9x4 0x6) SR: 84.12,David Warner
