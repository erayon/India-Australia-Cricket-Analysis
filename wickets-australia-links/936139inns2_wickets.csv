"breakthrough! Big John Hastings has done it. Amla across his crease again, aiming to the leg side and is taken on the back leg. He opts not to review. Umpire's call on impact",66/1,43906,8.3,lbw b Hastings 45 (33m 30b 9x4 0x6) SR: 150.00,Hashim Amla
"drops short, du Plessis shovels to the leg side... but picks out deep midwicket! Not the acme of shot selection there (other than in the Warner Bros sense) and Warner roars in celebration",140/2,44828,17.2,c Warner b Head 33 (37m 32b 4x4 0x6) SR: 103.12,Faf du Plessis
"touch short and de Kock pulls, h-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-g-e top edge and it swirls above Worrall coming in at fine leg... but he holds on! It was a spectacular take in the end, diving flat out because he was slightly out of position. The burly fast bowler proves he has good hands and that's a massive wicket for Australia",164/3,379143,20.5,c Worrall b Tremain 70 (86m 49b 6x4 2x6) SR: 142.85,Quinton de Kock
"goes for the reverse sweep, misses and the ball canons into the pads - that's out! May have been the quicker delivery from Zampa but, either way, Rossouw picked the wrong shot to play to a full, straight ball that looked to be skidding into middle and off",179/4,318845,23.4,lbw b Zampa 18 (25m 21b 1x4 0x6) SR: 85.71,Rilee Rossouw
"slapped high into the leg side - but he's picked out the man on the rope! Oh dear, not sure what Duminy was thinking there, a short break in play and that's the partnership scuppered. Swung across the line and Finch barely had to move, a step to the left and clutched to his chest",217/5,44932,31.1,c Finch b Hastings 20 (44m 26b 0x4 0x6) SR: 76.92,Jean-Paul Duminy
"the dot balls bring a wicket, Pretoious looking to work this from outside off into the leg side and gets a leading edge which loops into the covers...Warner has to take a few steps backwards, but it's simple catch",265/6,327830,37.4,c Warner b Marsh 15 (32m 20b 0x4 1x6) SR: 75.00,Dwaine Pretorius
