"Pathirana pleads and pleads and pleads and finally umpire Palliyaguruge says yes. Finch given lbw, but he reviews. Pushed through on middle, Finch went for the premeditated sweep, his front foot was across, and he was hit on the edge of his front pad. Hit well in line. But would that go on to knock over leg stump? Oh, HawkEye says it would <i>just</i> clip it! The ball and the stump are almost tangential! The finest of margins, working in Sri Lanka's favour",74/1,5334,5.3,lbw b Pathirana 55 (26m 19b 8x4 3x6) SR: 289.47,Aaron Finch
"two in the over! Khawaja stands, looks down, and walks off forlornly. This is tossed up on off stump, beats the inside edge of the prodding bat and thuds into the front pad. Right in front of middle, should be hitting leg, Pathirana screams, but no one can here him because all of Dambulla are screaming as well. <b>Oh wait, HawkEye says that would be missing</b>. There is plenty of turn out there, but that looked out to the naked eye...",74/2,215155,5.5,lbw b Pathirana 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Usman Khawaja
"that is superb! Warner steps down the track, but he can't get to the pitch of the ball. Lovely flight, and then it dips on the batsman. So beautiful Warner tries to push at the ball, having originally planned to slam it down the ground. He doesn't know how much it would turn. He doesn't know what to do. Ends up defending inside the line and the ball beats his outside edge to crash into his stumps",97/3,219889,7.1, b Pathirana 19 (36m 16b 3x4 0x6) SR: 118.75,David Warner
"gone this time! Head is lbw, trapped plumb in front. This one doesn't spin, Head plays for some. Flat through the air on off, the ball skids on and beats Head on the inside edge. No hesitation at all, gone.",197/4,530011,28.5,lbw b MDK Perera 40 (77m 60b 2x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Travis Head
