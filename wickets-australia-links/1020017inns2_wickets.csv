"real bonus for New Zealand. Marsh was really slow on the turn. This was full on the pads, he flicked this towards deep square, where Mitchell Santner got to the ball quickly and fired a throw on the halfvolley to Latham, who did the rest. Have to say that was an excellent take from the keeper, and Marsh is caught comfortably short of the crease. Why would you want to self-destruct like that? He was just starting to play some gorgeous shots",44/1,6683,7.2,run out (Santner/&dagger;Latham) 22 (29m 22b 4x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Shaun Marsh
"chopped on! New Zealand are back and indecision in footwork has cost Handscomb. Simply wafts at an away-going length ball, nothing shot really. No feet movement whatsoever. The ball crashes into the stumps off the inside edge",44/2,334337,7.4, b Boult 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Peter Handscomb
"got lucky with the previous delivery, this time he muscles it straight to the lone man at deep midwicket. Looked to go over long-on perhaps, ended up dragging it a bit, and towards the longer boundary there, he stood no chance. New Zealand back into this",119/3,5334,20.6,c Boult b Williamson 56 (86m 64b 5x4 2x6) SR: 87.50,Aaron Finch
"this one drifts back in, pitches outside off and spins away, Maxwell shapes to cut, gets the thinnest of edges through to Latham who rides the bounce and takes an excellent catch. Very thin spike, there wasn't much on hotspot either. Maxwell shakes his head as he walks off",120/4,325026,21.6,c &dagger;Latham b Santner 0 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Glenn Maxwell
"superb catch by Dean Brownlie at deep square leg. He had to be mindful of the ropes just behind him, but he kept his balance and judged the catch to perfection. Coming back to the delivery, excellent short ball at 140 clicks, Head had to fetch this from outside off. The ball got big on him but he went through with the stroke and simply top-edged it to the fielder in the deep. Lot of credit to the bowler, for the effort.",173/5,530011,32.2,c Brownlie b Boult 53 (97m 72b 5x4 0x6) SR: 73.61,Travis Head
"there was a wide slip in place specifically for this. Faulkner is squared up by the late movement, gets a thick edge that was dying on Taylor, who moves low to his left to complete a stunning catch. This is outstanding tactics from New Zealand. First to place the fielder there, and then set the batsman up before eventually.  sending him on his way. The front foot is fine, the umpires were checking for the catch. Kumar Dharmasena, the third umpire, had a couple of replays, before relaying his decision to the on-field umpire.",174/6,270484,32.6,c Taylor b Boult 0 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,James Faulkner
"he's picked out the fielder at long-on. Superb bowling from Santner, tossed this up but the ball dipped on Stoinis, who looked to slap this across the line but couldn't get underneath it and hit it straight to Neesham.",198/7,325012,39.1,c Neesham b Santner 42 (77m 48b 4x4 1x6) SR: 87.50,Marcus Stoinis
"one shot too many and he's gone! Cummins looks to go through with the pull but was beaten for pace and hurried into the stroke, ended up lobbing it to midwicket where Santner made no mistake. Relief in the New Zealand camp. Is that it for Australia?",249/8,489889,44.4,c Santner b Boult 27 (57m 35b 1x4 2x6) SR: 77.14,Pat Cummins
"he's got five! Ross Taylor was brought in at wide first slip position precisely prior to this delivery and the plan comes off. This is a cutter, gets a bit of grip and bounce, Zampa hangs his bat out without any conviction, gets a thick edge and Taylor does the rest.",253/9,379504,46.1,c Taylor b Boult 1 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00,Adam Zampa
"you beauty, Boult! Six wickets and <b> New Zealand have regained the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. </b> Subtle change in pace with that length ball, Hazlewood look to force that through the off side, plays outside the line and can only get a thick inside edge back onto the stumps. <b> New Zealand win the series 2-0. </b> These are Boult's best figures in ODIs, his second five-wicket haul in his career, and both have come against Australia. The last time he did it - at the 2015 World Cup at Eden Park - was equally special.",257/10,288284,46.6, b Boult 4 (5m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Josh Hazlewood
