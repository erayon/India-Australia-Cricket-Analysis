"gone. Moeen runs down the track, and Faulkner bowls a shortish slower ball. He swings across the line, and the extra bounce forces him to top-edge it high in the air, and the man at short cover settles comfortably under it",113/1,8917,17.4,c sub (XJ Doherty) b Faulkner 46 (69m 48b 3x4 3x6) SR: 95.83,Moeen Ali
"gone! That was full on off stump, and Taylor goes for the drive over extra cover, he's too close to the pitch of the ball and ends up toe-ending it and hitting it in the air, straight to mid-off",132/2,297635,22.2,c Faulkner b Henriques 5 (19m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 35.71,James Taylor
"that is that. The slower ball ends Bell's innings. He comes down the track, Sandhu bowls it shorter, and he goes through with the attempted flat-bat smack over mid-off. Hits high on the bat, and it loops to the left of mid-off, from where Starc manages to backtrack and dive to his left to take a smart catch",253/3,9062,41.2,c Starc b Sandhu 141 (175m 125b 15x4 1x6) SR: 112.80,Ian Bell
"got him first ball! That was back of a length, angling across, and Morgan feels for it outside off, looking to run it down to third man, and gets a thin edge through to Haddin",254/4,24598,41.4,c &dagger;Haddin b Sandhu 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Eoin Morgan
"gone! That's a length ball outside off, it was there to be hit, but Root, clearing his front leg, couldn't get any elevation on it, and he ended up popping it straight into mid-on's hands",275/5,303669,44.4,c Finch b Cummins 69 (101m 70b 6x4 0x6) SR: 98.57,Joe Root
"bowled him. Bopara had taken guard outside off stump, exposing all of his stumps, and Starc bowled him around the legs, clattering the base of leg stump with a low full-toss that swung from outside leg",303/6,10582,49.4, b Starc 7 (23m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 43.75,Ravi Bopara
"another, and it's a run out this time. Length ball, swinging away from off stump. Woakes swings and misses and they try to sneak a bye. Haddin's throw knocks back middle stump, and Buttler is short of his crease despite putting in the dive",303/7,308967,49.5,run out (&dagger;Haddin) 25 (38m 24b 2x4 0x6) SR: 104.16,Jos Buttler
"and that's another run-out, is it? Yup, and Australia have a team hat-trick to finish the innings. Broad makes room and Starc spears in another yorker, just outside off. For some reason, Broad didn't even attempt a shot and they looked for another bye. Haddin rolled it into the base of the stumps, and Woakes was well short of his crease.",303/8,247235,49.6,run out (&dagger;Haddin) 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Chris Woakes
