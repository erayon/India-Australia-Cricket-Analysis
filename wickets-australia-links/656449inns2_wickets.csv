"full and straight, swinging back in a touch, Ghani gets the bat down in time, hits it well, but there is a short straight midwicket in place. Sharp catch but straight at him",30/1,711559,6.3,c Faulkner b Johnson 12 (28m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 63.15,Usman Ghani
"and this was long due. Ahmadi has not been fancying getting behind the line of the ball. Hazlewood bowls short of a length, Ahmadi is away from the line and just opens the face. Easy enough catch head high for Clarke at second slip",32/2,308235,7.4,c Clarke b Hazlewood 13 (34m 24b 1x4 0x6) SR: 54.16,Javed Ahmadi
"lovely catch by Smith. Great hands he has. Stanikzai swings hard again, gets a thick edge that flies towards third man. M Marsh is the man running in, and this should be his catch, which is what Smith believes too, but Marsh doesn't look too keen. Smith goes back into the catch. There can be a collision. Smith catches it over his shoulder, arches back. A collision is avoided. Catch is taken",46/3,320652,10.2,c Smith b Johnson 4 (12m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Asghar Stanikzai
Clarke has a wicket took. Another sweep. To a length ball. Gets a top edge for an easy catch at short fine leg. His first ODI wicket since September 2012,94/4,318339,19.4,c Johnson b Clarke 17 (33m 31b 2x4 0x6) SR: 54.83,Samiullah Shenwari
"lovely catch by Finch. Short of a length, just outside off, he has opened the face on it, everybody is looking towards third man to cut it, but Finch from first slip has gone flying to his right and pouched this. Goes two handed, but it gets stuck in one hand",94/5,318334,20.1,c Finch b Johnson 33 (54m 35b 2x4 2x6) SR: 94.28,Nawroz Mangal
"<b>Nabi has reviewed this</b>. Nabi looks to paddle, Clarke is running back towards short fine, then he realises Nabi has got a soft edge, and he runs back in towards the stumps to catch this. Nabi says this has come off the arm. He is right, it has come off the arm, but after hitting the top edge. And oh by the way, the snicko has not registered anything even though there is a clear edge here",103/6,25913,24.2,c Clarke b Maxwell 2 (20m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00,Mohammad Nabi
Starc and his yorker. Swinging in towards the base of the middle stump. At 148ks. Under the toe end of the bat. Too good for Najib,131/7,524049,31.1, b Starc 24 (42m 31b 1x4 1x6) SR: 77.41,Najibullah Zadran
it was a matter of time with Dawlat backing away every ball. Out comes this dipping yorker at 151ks at the base of off. Too good again,131/8,516561,31.5, b Starc 0 (3m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Dawlat Zadran
"they don't have a review left, and he has to walk back even if he has not edged it. This is short of a length, outside off, nips back in, goes between the bat and him. Haddin takes the catch. Australia are pretty confident they have got the edge, but Zazai is not walking until the umpire raises the finger. Snicko registers a small little spike",140/9,420402,36.2,c &dagger;Haddin b Hazlewood 10 (47m 40b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Afsar Zazai
"a simple catch at short midwicket ends it. The biggest win WCs. This is short, gets on to him quicker than he expects it, gets a soft edge on the pull, and Johnson collects his fourth wicket",142/10,311427,37.3,c Warner b Johnson 7 (27m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 38.88,Hamid Hassan
