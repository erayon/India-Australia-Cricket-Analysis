"what a catch. Stunning stuff from Smith. Absolutely stunning. Fuller length outside off, Hales skews the drive off the outer half of the bat towards short cover where Smith is lurking, he dives high to his right to take a spectacular, two-handed catch.",37/1,249866,5.5,c Smith b Coulter-Nile 18 (25m 20b 4x4 0x6) SR: 90.00,Alex Hales
"gone this time. Roy has thrown another one away. Very poor shot considering the circumstances. Full outside off, cross-seam, maybe generating some extra bounce. Roy, however, loosely wafts at the ball and gets a thick outside edge. Wade takes a good diving catch to his right.",68/2,298438,11.4,c &dagger;Wade b Cummins 31 (53m 32b 6x4 0x6) SR: 96.87,Jason Roy
"Taylor nicks behind. Good length and largely holds its line outside off, Taylor seeks to run it fine to third man. But can only outside-edge it to Wade. Marsh takes high-fives from his team-mates",119/3,297635,21.2,c &dagger;Wade b Marsh 43 (68m 57b 5x4 0x6) SR: 75.43,James Taylor
"pretty full and on the stumps at 145ks, Stokes drives back to the bowler, who stretches his left hand and plucks it out. He has a aim at the stumps (sensing a run-out chance), Stokes, who is out of the crease, fends the throw off with his left glove/ instinctively looks to protect himself, as he loses his balance and collapses on the floor. Wade goes up. Starc appeals. Umpires Dharmasena and Robinson converge. The soft signal is not out. <strong>Stokes has been given out obstructing the field</strong> by the TV umpire Joe Wilson. Smith, Morgan intervene and have a chat with the umpires. Boos ring around Lord's. Morgan isn't happy. Stokes drags himself off the field. Roy, in the balcony, can't believe it. Drama! Drama!",141/4,311158,25.4,obstructing the field 10 (18m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 142.85,Ben Stokes
"an appeal for lbw, Tim Robinson does not budge. <strong>Australia want a review</strong>. Maxi's front foot is fine. Flighted on middle, with a hint of turn. He misses the defensive push, is beaten on the inside edge and is rapped on the front pad. The ball pitched in line, impact in line, it would have hit the top of middle. Buttler is sent packing for a three-ball duck..",142/5,308967,26.2,lbw b Maxwell 0 (5m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Jos Buttler
"gone this time. Moeen goes. Another rather soft wicket. Moeen gets down to sweep and gets a thick top edge, the ball flies off towards deep square leg who settles under it early and takes an easy catch. Nothing delivery from Maxwell but England in serious trouble now.",171/6,8917,32.3,c Marsh b Maxwell 8 (19m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 53.33,Moeen Ali
is that out? Given. Woakes goes now. England falling apart. Woakes looks to swivel-pull the ball into the leg side but gets a thick inside edge which carries low to Wade. Lord's is quiet. The Stokes dismissal has had a bearing impact on the game.,183/7,247235,35.3,c &dagger;Wade b Cummins 6 (11m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Chris Woakes
"another wicket. If England were in trouble then, they are in deeper trouble now. Fullish on off, Rashid clips the ball uppishly and straight to mid-on, where NCN takes a diving catch to his left.",187/8,244497,37.4,c Coulter-Nile b Cummins 2 (10m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Adil Rashid
"Starc is accurate first up, silencing the crowd. A ball he has gained lots of applause for over the past few months. From around the wicket, full and straight with a hint of reverse. Plunkett backs away, makes room but is cleaned up. The leg stump is taken.",242/9,19264,41.1, b Starc 24 (17m 12b 5x4 0x6) SR: 200.00,Liam Plunkett
"gone this time, that's the end of an amazing innings by Morgan and a really, good match. <strong>Australia win by 64 runs.</strong> Morgan and Smith have a chat while shaking hands. Good length outside off, Morgan looks to clear the long-off boundary with a heave but the ball lobs up nicely and sits in long-off's lap. Australia go 2-0 up in the five-match series.",245/10,24598,42.3,c Maxwell b Cummins 85 (135m 87b 4x4 4x6) SR: 97.70,Eoin Morgan
