"<b>bowled him!</b> Bumrah's length is tough to pick for most, let alone a debutant. He sits on the back foot. And swipes across the line on length. It's just short of good length and skids through, as it does for Bumrah. Just above knee height and into the off stump",15/1,557295,3.5, b Bumrah 1 (m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 12.50,Hilton Cartwright
"<b>out the next ball!</b> If you think Bumrah's bowling action is queer, you should see this catch! This is a length ball, on middle stump. Straightens and climbs as he looks to flick this into the leg side. It's a top edge that flies over Bumrah at short fine leg. He runs backwards in pursuit...only to realise he has overdone it. By the time it comes down, he's facing the crowd. Extraordinarily, he arches backwards, puts up a reverse-cup and follows this swerving ball to hold on. As if the ball from the crowd! Stunning",20/2,267192,4.6,c Bumrah b Pandya 1 (m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00,Steven Smith
"<b>caught behind.</b> Offcutters, slower ball, knuckle balls. Australia have not been able to get themselves in at all. This is a knuckle ball pushed wide, back of a length. Head has plenty of room. But he's early on the shot. Swings hard and gets an outside edge that lobs harmlessly through to Dhoni - almost dipping on him - and he completes a simple take",29/3,530011,6.4,c &dagger;Dhoni b Pandya 5 (m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Travis Head
"<b>good catch!</b> It's a slider from Kuldeep. After the slow one that turns away from the corridor. This is straight through at the same line. Warner goes for the cut and gets a big outside edge. Dhoni takes a sharp one that nearly slides out of his gloves. A slight juggle to hold on to it. Kuldeep is ecstatic. Warner, less so.",35/4,219889,7.6,c &dagger;Dhoni b Kuldeep Yadav 25 (m 28b 2x4 0x6) SR: 89.28,David Warner
"<b>holes out to long-on!</b> Tossed up wide outside off. The perfect place for someone slogging across the line. On length, it's still hittable. But it's also turning away. He gets it off the toe and straight to the fielder. Chahal holds up his arms like everything was planned.",76/5,325026,11.6,c Pandey b Chahal 39 (m 18b 3x4 4x6) SR: 216.66,Glenn Maxwell
"wrong'un. Good length outside off. Crouches early to set up for the slog sweep. But again, it's spinning away. He lifts it high towards deep midwicket and Jadeja takes it cleanly",76/6,325012,12.3,c sub (RA Jadeja) b Kuldeep Yadav 3 (m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.00,Marcus Stoinis
"Wade steps down the track and flashes hard, Chahal drags his length back outside off and darts it wide outside off, well past the batsman's reach. Dhoni collects it and whips the bails off. Chepauk raises itself to a big roar again. More questions over Wade after a poor series with the bat in Bangladesh",93/7,230193,15.3,st &dagger;Dhoni b Chahal 9 (m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 90.00,Matthew Wade
"The asking rate has ballooned. Cummins aims to prick the balloon with a slog over midwicket, against the break. But a top edge balloons to short third man. It started on middle and turned away to claim the edge",109/8,489889,17.1,c Bumrah b Chahal 9 (m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 128.57,Pat Cummins
"Heaved flat and hard to Jadhav at deep midwicket. Good length slower one at 114ks, not sure if that was a knuckle ball. Coulter-Nile can't clear the man in the deep. Rohit gives Jadhav a leaping high-five",127/9,261354,19.2,c Jadhav b Kumar 2 (m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Nathan Coulter-Nile
