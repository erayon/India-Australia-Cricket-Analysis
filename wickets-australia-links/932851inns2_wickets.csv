"plumb in front! Full and straight, Finch shuffles across, trying to flick over midwicket but just plain misses a straight one. The umpire's finger was up quicker than I could say out. Easy decision, Finch doesn't bother reviewing.",44/1,5334,7.4,lbw b Holder 19 (33m 30b 4x4 0x6) SR: 63.33,Aaron Finch
"Benn gets Khawaja. Rather, Khawaja gives it away. Subdued celebrations. Drifts outside leg, sticks in the surface. Khawaja flicks early and spoons a catch to short midwicket",85/2,215155,16.6,c Holder b Benn 27 (41m 38b 5x4 0x6) SR: 71.05,Usman Khawaja
"Narine returns and strikes! Umpire Llong's finger goes up. Was that doing too much? Looked so. Biting offbreak, tossed full, from Narine, Smith is deceived and is rapped on the front pad in line with the stumps. Perhaps, curling down leg. Smith has to go though. He could have review it. The tracker confirms that it was slipping down leg",92/3,267192,19.2,lbw b Narine 6 (10m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Steven Smith
"Narine takes down Maxi for a duck! Big offbreak, rips in from outside off, shoots through the gate and nails the off stump. Maxi aimed a cover drive and missed. Two wickets in three balls for Narine. He still has the fizz",92/4,325026,19.4, b Narine 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Glenn Maxwell
