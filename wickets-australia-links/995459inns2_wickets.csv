"he's got Warner first ball! Nice and tempting line just outside off, Warner drives, the ball moves away just a bit and the edge is taken easily by Chandimal! Thisara is pumped and charges towards his team-mates to celebrate. What a big wicket tht is",3/1,219889,1.1,c &dagger;Chandimal b NLTC Perera 1 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,David Warner
"make it two for this Perera, he's got both openers out of the way! This one was not on hittable length outisde off, Finch went ahead with his slog for the leg side but only managed an inside edge onto the middle stump!",16/2,5334,3.3, b NLTC Perera 4 (16m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14,Aaron Finch
"is it the pressure that's got Smith, he's handed a catch to mid-on! Came down the track, took the ball almost on half-volley but failed to clear mid-on where Dilruwan took a couple of steps back to pouch it easily just over his head",41/3,267192,9.2,c MDK Perera b Aponso 30 (34m 33b 5x4 0x6) SR: 90.90,Steven Smith
"bowled him! Bailey's struggle is over for the night. Aponso slowed it up by giving the ball a lot of air, drawing Bailey forward into the cover drive. more of a slap really because he was not to the pitch of the ball. The ball then dipped on the right-hander, falling under his bat and skidded straight on with the arm, instead of spinning away, to hit off stump",102/4,4451,22.5, b Aponso 27 (74m 46b 0x4 0x6) SR: 58.69,George Bailey
"he's been stumped now! Prasanna drew Henriques forward with a flighted legbreak, the ball dipped and pitched in front of his lunge on the front foot and spun past the outside edge, the keeper took the bails off before Henriques could get his foot back in",118/5,5961,27.4,st &dagger;Chandimal b Prasanna 4 (20m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Moises Henriques
"it's that man again - Thisara Perera - and he's got Wade off a full toss! He came down the track again, ended up sweeping a low full toss high on the leg side and Gunathilaka took one of the easiest catches at deep midwicket",182/6,230193,39.6,c Gunathilaka b NLTC Perera 76 (118m 88b 3x4 0x6) SR: 86.36,Matthew Wade
"that's the other settled batsman to fall within three balls, Head top-edges one and Dilshan takes it! It was well outside off, hardly any pace, and Head opened up to pull it away to leg but ended up edging it high on the off side where Dilshan ran in from point",184/7,530011,40.2,c Dilshan b Mathews 31 (54m 48b 3x4 0x6) SR: 64.58,Travis Head
"slow offcutter at 108 and second wicket for Mathews in the over with that return catch! Pitched it up and rolled his fingers a bit over that one, Starc merely pushed it back in the air and Mathews took it comfortably around waist height",185/8,311592,40.4,c &amp; b Mathews 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mitchell Starc
"swept away to the leg side and he's found deep midwicket, third wicket for Aponso! It was pitched up, and Zampa went down on a knee to sweep it away nicely but it didn't go all the way and Dilshan had to run to his right to make it nine down",202/9,379504,45.5,c Dilshan b Aponso 5 (17m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 31.25,Adam Zampa
"flighted again, this time Faulkner is hit on the pad in front of leg stump, SL appeal and the finger has gone up. But Faulkner <strong>reviews it</strong>. Replays show no inside edge and ball-tracking shows it was 'hitting' the stumps. Australia all out for 206",206/10,270484,47.2,lbw b Aponso 13 (29m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 68.42,James Faulkner
