"beautiful over. Perfect seam and swing bowling. A few outswingers, then inswinger from wide on the crease, and ends up with a sucker punch of an outswinger. Full, just outside off, Finch thinks he can drive at it, but it is not quite as full as he expects. Which means there is time for the ball to move and take the edge through to first slip where Nawroz Mangal takes a smart low catch",14/1,5334,2.6,c Nawroz Mangal b Dawlat Zadran 4 (14m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 44.44,Aaron Finch
"there won't be a triple hundred today. At least one undesirable record avoided by Afghanistan. This is bowled cross-seam, which is possibly why it has come slower on to him. Warner gets under, goes on a knee, and wants to hit a massive six. Just gets too much under it, and sends it miles into the air. It has hit a meteor or something and has come back for Nabi to take a really difficult catch at mid-on. He goes reverse cup and just about holds on to it with the ball not landing sweetly in the palms",274/2,219889,37.3,c Mohammad Nabi b Shapoor Zadran 178 (164m 133b 19x4 5x6) SR: 133.83,David Warner
"Smith won't have a hundred. Shapoor has bowled well, has gone for a lot still, but this is good reward. Again the cross seam means it doesn't quite come on, and he is early into the drive. Straight to mid-off. Taken",339/3,267192,42.5,c Najibullah Zadran b Shapoor Zadran 95 (173m 98b 8x4 1x6) SR: 96.93,Steven Smith
that's a lovely yorker. Hassan brings out the mini chainsaw. Inswinging yorker. On the middle and leg. Dips on him too. Beats the inside edge. Possibly takes the toe on the way to the stumps,382/4,270484,46.1, b Hamid Hassan 7 (15m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 116.66,James Faulkner
"there won't be a fastest WC hundred here. Maxwell yet to score an ODI hundred. Slower ball, half-volley, draws a sort of a mis-hit, and he ends up offering a catch to extra cover. Another excellent innings by Maxwell at the WACA, but still not a hundred for him",390/5,325026,47.2,c Mohammad Nabi b Dawlat Zadran 88 (45m 39b 6x4 7x6) SR: 225.64,Glenn Maxwell
"short ball, down the wicket, doesn't quite time this, and he finds deep midwicket with this hit",417/6,272450,49.6,c Najibullah Zadran b Nawroz Mangal 8 (17m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 88.88,Mitchell Marsh
