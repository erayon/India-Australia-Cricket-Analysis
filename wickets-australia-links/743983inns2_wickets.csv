"full, fast, and that is out! Hales was done for pace, and despite a brief consultation he opts not to review. Stunning start from the lightning-quick Cummins. Hales hasn't had a lot of joy in this series so far",1/1,249866,1.2,lbw b Cummins 0 (6m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Alex Hales
"a change of ends, a change of luck! Cummins lures Roy into a loose poke into the covers. A tame end to a cracking innings. Scrambled seam and Roy was through the stroke too soon.",73/2,298438,10.1,c Finch b Cummins 36 (45m 33b 7x4 0x6) SR: 109.09,Jason Roy
"wow, what a take! Massive dive to his left, down the leg-side, as Taylor flicked so fine that it was almost the perfect one-day stroke. But Wade was equal to the task, and that is a massive breakthrough",89/3,297635,15.4,c &dagger;Wade b Marsh 41 (60m 42b 8x4 0x6) SR: 97.61,James Taylor
"bowled him, slips a yorker under the bat, Stokes is gone! May have taken the pace off a touch and Stokes was beaten aiming a push down the ground, he looks back in disgust... A decent, controlled knock, and a useful stand but that's opened up a chink for Australia to try and exploit",180/4,311158,33.3, b Marsh 41 (63m 54b 5x4 0x6) SR: 75.92,Ben Stokes
"pitched up and sliced to backward point WHERE MAXWELL GRABS A SCREAMER! Australia are still in this, Morgan falls short of a hundred thanks to a brilliant one-handed take from Maxwell low to his right, more than making up for his fumble a couple of balls ago. Cummins has his third and England still have a bit of work to do",238/5,24598,39.4,c Maxwell b Cummins 92 (118m 92b 8x4 2x6) SR: 100.00,Eoin Morgan
"reverse-sweep, through to the keeper with a loud cry of triumph, and they have gone for the <B>review</B>. It's a fair delivery, and is there a hint of a hot spot on the glove? He's a goner",261/6,297433,42.4,c &dagger;Wade b Maxwell 31 (43m 27b 3x4 1x6) SR: 114.81,Jonny Bairstow
"wow, was that actually a clean catch? It's becoming commonplace these days, to take the ball above the head, on the rope, stagger back, lob the ball back into play, leap back over the rope, snaffle the rebound in mid-air and land as if nothing has happened. But Glenn Maxwell has just done it again! And Plunkett's clunk-it innings is over",282/7,19264,45.1,c Maxwell b Cummins 17 (14m 10b 2x4 1x6) SR: 170.00,Liam Plunkett
