"poor shot selection has consumed him. Not much feet movement as Khawaja looks to cut, but the ball was a lot fuller than he would have liked, and the thin edge is pouched by Denesh Ramdin. Boundaries were reeling off the blade, so a timely wicket for West Indies. The skipper has struck and it seems there isn't much wrong with his hamstring going by his roaring celebration there.",28/1,215155,4.3,c &dagger;Ramdin b Holder 14 (20m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Usman Khawaja
"KP strikes in his first over and <a href=""http://www.espncricinfo.com/tri-nation-west-indies-2016/content/story/1029417.html"" target=""_blank"">nearly does a Tahir, again</a>. He looks towards the stands, perhaps, and does the finger-on-the-lip celebration. The lack of pace does Finch in. Back of a length incutter, comes in from outside off at 115ks, Finch aims to force it from there. This means that he drags a catch to Samuels at deep midwicket",69/2,5334,12.3,c Samuels b Pollard 47 (57m 41b 6x4 1x6) SR: 114.63,Aaron Finch
"<b> got him! </b> Bailey was just starting to tick over, but the slightest of mistakes has cost him. Brathwaite bowls an incoming length ball which Bailey looks to run it down to third man, but there wasn't much room to work with as he ends up chopping it back onto the stumps. The squeeze was on, you got the feeling that Bailey was getting a little edgy to score after a string of dots early on in his innings, but that isn't to be tonight.",120/3,4451,24.1, b Brathwaite 22 (44m 44b 2x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,George Bailey
"Christmas has come early for Gabriel after what was a horror spell until now. Rang long hop this one - too short - and Smith tries to fetch the pull from outside off when he could have easily looked to cut that behind point, gets a top edge and Marlon Samuels gleefully accepts the dolly at midwicket. Smith knew he was dead the moment he hit that. A hint of extra bounce on this surface also played its part.",152/4,267192,30.2,c Samuels b Gabriel 46 (106m 59b 4x4 0x6) SR: 77.96,Steven Smith
"another one bites the dust. Gabriel didn't celebrate Smith's wicket, but that isn't the case now as he roars in delight. This one's an incoming length ball that nips back in a touch from the off stump, Maxwell misses the line completely and is struck plumb in front of leg stump Possibly a big moment in the match!",156/5,325026,30.6,lbw b Gabriel 4 (4m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Glenn Maxwell
"Chopped on! The bails are sent flying. Having gone wicketless on Friday, Benn nips out Marsh. Pushed through quicker, 90.4ks, and turns away from the right hander. He has a lazy waft away from the body after stepping back and chops it onto the stumps via an inside edge. The WI fans are dancing and grooving in the stands",173/6,272450,36.5, b Benn 32 (55m 45b 4x4 0x6) SR: 71.11,Mitchell Marsh
"first wicket for Narine, he has his revenge this time. Nothing wrong with the legality of the delivery. He tosses it up generously, the ball spins away sharply and beats Starc's wild swing. In trying to slog again, Starc was outside the crease as Ramdin collected the ball cleanly and whipped the bails off in a jiffy, with the backfoot a good couple of yards out.",211/7,311592,43.4,st &dagger;Ramdin b Narine 17 (26m 25b 1x4 1x6) SR: 68.00,Mitchell Starc
"swung in the air, this goes miles in the air, Bravo settles underneath that at mid-on and takes the skier without much fuss. Coulter-Nile went across the line even as the bat face turned in his hand, which meant there wasn't much power generated behind the stroke. Easy as they come for Bravo",238/8,261354,46.5,c Bravo b Holder 15 (16m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 150.00,Nathan Coulter-Nile
"swung across the line, Wade gets a thick inside edge to Brathwaite's left. Zampa took off for the run without realising the bowler moved to his left. Then it was a battle between the two, and Brathwaite runs all the way to the stumps to remove the bails at the non-striker's end. Zampa was a couple of yards short of the crease",264/9,379504,49.4,run out (Brathwaite) 5 (14m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Adam Zampa
