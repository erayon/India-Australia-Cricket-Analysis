"gone! Exactly where Australia should have been bowling from the start. Pushes it slightly wider, a full length on a fourth/fifth-stump line. De Kock's intention is to score and so pushes at it with hard hands. All he succeeds in doing is chipping a catch to short cover, brought there due to the lack of swing. Against the run of play",37/1,379143,5.6,c Marsh b Boland 12 (23m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Quinton de Kock
"big, big wicket. Mennie goes through Amla and the stumps are sent cartwheeling. What a beauty. Not sure Amla could do anything about that. Mennie goes wide of the crease, pitches this on off and middle. like most deliveries today, Amla thinks this is coming back in.  but it pitches and straightens and beats Amla's flick to clatter into off stump. To beat a batsman like Amla with a bit of swing, that's a special delivery.",37/2,43906,6.4, b Mennie 25 (27m 22b 5x4 0x6) SR: 113.63,Hashim Amla
"another one! Faf troubled with some nagging lines attempts an exuberant lofted drive, but the ball pitches on off and moves back in. Not prodigious but enough and beats Faf's inside edge and take the top of off and middle. Faf undone by pressure and the movement, both equally responsible for the wicket",52/3,44828,10.6, b Mennie 11 (22m 17b 2x4 0x6) SR: 64.70,Faf du Plessis
"out! Soft dismissal. Duminy falls. A rather selfless stroke. Full and wide outside off, Duminy wanted to open the face to drive towards deep cover in order to get Rossouw back on strike. Instead, carves a ball to backward point because the ball is too wide to fetch and hit that much in front of square. Quality, quality knock from JP. Hardly mis-hit a ball",230/4,44932,38.2,c Bailey b Mennie 73 (109m 75b 8x4 0x6) SR: 97.33,Jean-Paul Duminy
"slogged across the line, and he's holed out to Mitch Marsh at long-on. It was the slower one which he didn't completely get underneath and only managed to skew it off the bottom half of the bat. He knew immediately that it wasn't timed well. Rossouw walks off to a round of applause, this has been a super knock",281/5,318845,44.5,c Marsh b Tremain 122 (156m 118b 14x4 2x6) SR: 103.38,Rilee Rossouw
"super delivery. Death rattle. This is full and straight on middle, he looks to back away and squeeze that behind point but the ball clattered into the stumps off a very fine inside-edge.",306/6,540316,47.5, b Boland 11 (14m 9b 0x4 1x6) SR: 122.22,Andile Phehlukwayo
"picks out Steven Smith at deep cover. Looked like he wanted to hit it to wide long-off but stiff breeze may have played part in him not hitting it where it wanted. It was a slower delivery too, which made it all the more tougher for Miller. Useful knock nonetheless",308/7,321777,48.3,c Smith b Tremain 39 (46m 29b 4x4 0x6) SR: 134.48,David Miller
"pokes at that without any conviction and the thick edge has been well taken by Wade, who dives full-length forward to complete the low catch. Third umpire was called for and replays only confirmed Wade's belief.",309/8,297583,48.4,c &dagger;Wade b Tremain 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Kyle Abbott
