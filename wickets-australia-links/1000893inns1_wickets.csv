"Khawaja nicks behind, Rizwan dives across to his left and grasps the edge. 44 boundary-less balls, including the front-foot no-ball, and Pakistan find the breakthrough. Full and slanting away from off stump, Khawaja's front foot is nowhere close to the pitch of this delivery. He simply throws his bat at a big drive and edges it behind. Hasan Ali celebrates the wicket with a fist pump",92/1,215155,17.2,c &dagger;Mohammad Rizwan b Hasan Ali 30 (76m 49b 2x4 0x6) SR: 61.22,Usman Khawaja
"....so of course he goes now. Full and wide outside off, he's backed away too much and falls over as he reaches for this. Gets a thin nick that goes low to Riwan's left and he's pouched it",212/2,219889,35.3,c &dagger;Mohammad Rizwan b Hasan Ali 130 (156m 119b 11x4 2x6) SR: 109.24,David Warner
"<b>he's got him!</b> Good length outside off, tails in, he walks across and is trapped in front. <b>Smith reviews.</b> No bat involved. That's out. Hits him in line and it would've crashed into middle and leg. What an over from Hasan Ali.",213/3,267192,35.5,lbw b Hasan Ali 49 (83m 48b 5x4 0x6) SR: 102.08,Steven Smith
"Phew, Pakistan finally hang onto a catch (yes, you read that right). Head pre-meditates, ventures a long way outside leg. He is chased by a short ball, which gets big. Attempts a hook and skies a top-edge to Malik at deep square leg",313/4,530011,46.3,c Shoaib Malik b Mohammad Amir 51 (55m 36b 2x4 4x6) SR: 141.66,Travis Head
"Skied to long-on. Chest-high catch, Imad Wasim clings onto it.... just It nearly popped out at the last moment. Pitched up and outside off, right in the hitting slot. Wade lofts and miscues it to Imad. Fourth wicket for Hasan",339/5,230193,49.1,c Imad Wasim b Hasan Ali 5 (13m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Matthew Wade
"Sharjeel hangs onto a dolly, and Hasan does the <i>sajdah</i>, <b>celebrating his maiden five-for</b>. His figures of 5 for 52 stand out amid this carnage. Very full and outside off, Maxwell flits around in the crease and shovel-whips it in the air. Sharjeel takes it at deep square leg. He did not even have to budge",353/6,325026,49.6,c Sharjeel Khan b Hasan Ali 78 (70m 44b 10x4 1x6) SR: 177.27,Glenn Maxwell
