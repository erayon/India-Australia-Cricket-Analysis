uppish and there's the first wicket. Finch is clearly hustled for pace as he hops back to whip it to square leg. He had to fetch the ball from outside off as the extra bounce means the ball lobs off the leading edge to mid-on. Brathwaite is pumped as he leaps in joy to celebrate that. So the bowling change has worked for the hosts!,35/1,5334,4.3,c Samuels b Brathwaite 16 (20m 11b 3x4 0x6) SR: 145.45,Aaron Finch
"first ODI wicket for Gabriel, and it's a peach to get Khawaja. Angles a length ball across after all those deliveries on the pads, and is rewarded immediately. This was bowled at an angle where Khawaja simply had to play, and he made the mistake of playing with an angled bat as the thin edge is well pouched by Ramdin, diving to his right. Joy for West Indies. They're delighted as Gabriel is mobbed by his team-mates. Two in two!",35/2,215155,5.1,c &dagger;Ramdin b Gabriel 17 (24m 17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Usman Khawaja
"soft, soft dismissal! Bailey falls, three balls after the drinks break. Length ball, drifts in on off, grips in the surface, and turns away. Bailey is left searching for a leg-side flick. Instead, he plops a leading edge into the lap of KP at short extra cover",99/3,4451,18.3,c Pollard b Benn 34 (48m 46b 5x4 0x6) SR: 73.91,George Bailey
"that's the wicket West Indies were longing for. Smith doesn't even wait to see what the third umpire has to offer. It was a full toss which Marsh whipped to wide long-on. A second didn't look on but they decided to chance their luck, and unfortunately it didn't work this time. Darren Bravo fired the throw at the bowler' end on the bounce, and Benn collected that cleanly before swiftly dislodging the bails to beat Smith's desperate full-length dive. Is that the breakthrough that turns it around for West Indies? The game is back in the balance",221/4,267192,41.4,run out (Bravo/Benn) 78 (145m 107b 5x4 0x6) SR: 72.89,Steven Smith
