"taken at mid off, Guptill's gone! It was pitched up again, Guptill merely chipped it down the ground with a drive, maybe looking to clear mid off, but Cummins went to his right to complete a good catch",40/1,226492,3.5,c Cummins b Starc 11 (m 14b 1x4 1x6) SR: 78.57,Martin Guptill
"he gets it off the middle but finds the man at mid-off! End of a superb innings by Baz, played, I am sure, with a badly hurting left hand. He gave himself room and looked to clear this over the off side, but just did not get the elevation. Easy catch for the fielder. But yet again, he has set New Zealand on the road to victory with a massive thrust up the order",78/2,37737,7.4,c Starc b Cummins 50 (m 24b 7x4 3x6) SR: 208.33,Brendon McCullum
"knocks him over, there goes the off stump! Taylor tried a cross-batted shot for the length delivery just around off, the ball swung in and went right through the gate to rattle the off stump. The players head off for what was supposed to be innings break at this time",79/3,38699,8.1, b Starc 1 (m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Ross Taylor
"middle stump's gone, first ball! Elliott left a big gap between bat and pad for the straight delivery that pitched around off and came in to rattle middle stump, he didn't have much footwork either and pushed only tentatively at the ball. Happens on the first ball",79/4,44956,8.2, b Starc 0 (m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Grant Elliott
"he slogs and he gives a catch! It was a length delivery just outside off, Anderson went down on a knee for the slog sweep and slammed it straight to mid on where Cummins took a good, low catch. They are checking for the catch now, Anderson waiting at the boundary. Cummins was down on his knees as the ball was dipping on him, replays show a part of the ball was out of his hands and they aren't clear enough to say if the ball hit the ground for sure or not. Given out finally, Anderson walks back again",131/5,277662,19.4,c Cummins b Maxwell 26 (m 42b 2x4 1x6) SR: 61.90,Corey Anderson
"peach of a delivery from Starc and that deserves a wicket! Nasty bouncer around middle stump, it was quick, and by the time Ronchi could sway out of the line by bending back like Keanu Reaves, the ball took some glove on the way",139/6,7502,20.6,c &dagger;Haddin b Starc 6 (m 7b 0x4 1x6) SR: 85.71,Luke Ronchi
"wicket off a full toss, chipped straight to mid on! Innocuous and low full toss on the pads, Vettori hangs his head down after handing a straightforward catch to mid on",145/7,38710,21.5,c Warner b Cummins 2 (m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Daniel Vettori
"Starc pumps the air, he's hit the stumps! Full delivery on middle, Milne exposed his stumps a bit, went for the drive and missed it completely",146/8,450860,22.3, b Starc 0 (m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Adam Milne
"<b>GONE</b>, Starc's on fire! He knows how to bowl those yorkers, doesn't he! Targets the off stump, Southee tries to put it away on the leg side but it's too quick at 150kmh and rattles the stumps",146/9,232364,22.4, b Starc 0 (m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Tim Southee
