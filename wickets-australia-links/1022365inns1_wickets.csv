"edged and Warner is gone! That is a superb delivery from Wood, inch-perfect line, kicking off the deck and nibbling half-a-bat's width away from the left-hander! He was just beginning to find his range, but Australia's danger man is extracted in his prime",40/1,219889,7.2,c &dagger;Buttler b Wood 21 (29m 25b 4x4 0x6) SR: 84.00,David Warner
"Finch misfires! Just as he was beginning to look very dangerous, he tried to launch Stokes into West Bromwich and ended up hitting the ball straight up, to be taken smartly by Morgan circling under it from mid-off. Came right off the toe of the bat, maybe deceived by a legcutter from Stokes",136/2,5334,22.5,c Morgan b Stokes 68 (98m 64b 8x4 0x6) SR: 106.25,Aaron Finch
"gone, slogged to mid-on! He's played a few impressive strokes - but that won't go down as one of them. Might have been the googly from Rashid but, either way, Henriques wasn't to the pitch trying to hit down the ground and it screwed off the inside half of the bat, looping tamely to mid-on",161/3,5961,27.4,c Plunkett b Rashid 17 (17m 19b 3x4 0x6) SR: 89.47,Moises Henriques
"gottim, plinked to mid-off! Huge wicket for England, Smith hangs his head in disgust, a really soft way to go, maybe he was expecting something quicker to start off with but instead wafts at an 85mph loosener and sends it looping slowly, tantalisingly, irresistibly to the man on the edge of the ring",181/4,267192,32.1,c Plunkett b Wood 56 (104m 77b 5x4 0x6) SR: 72.72,Steven Smith
"caught in the deep! Brilliant from Roy! Short ball from Wood, hit hard and flat, it's six all the way, but round swoops Roy, plucking the ball above his head, foot a millimetre from the line, then in that now-typical-but-still-awesome manner, tosses the ball up as his momentum takes him over, then gathering when back in play. Stunning. The umpires are checking, but this looks clean... Roy certainly thought so, and so does the third umpire!",239/5,325026,42.3,c Roy b Wood 20 (44m 31b 2x4 0x6) SR: 64.51,Glenn Maxwell
"googly! Wades reads it about as well as I can read Hindi. Three fielders converge but Rashid calls for his own catch as the ball loops straight up in the air, and England are really taking control in the slog-overs now",245/6,230193,43.3,c &amp; b Rashid 2 (5m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Matthew Wade
"that's terrible! An attempted googly, comes out as a leg-stump full toss, Starc slaps across the line as if substituting his bat for a damp tuna-fish, and up loops another facile catch, this time for Root behind the stumps!",245/7,311592,43.6,c Root b Rashid 0 (2m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mitchell Starc
"too easy for Rashid, who finishes his spell with a four-for! A lollipop push straight back to the bowler, neither forward nor back, and utterly unsure of which direction that would spin. England are rampant!",253/8,489889,45.6,c &amp; b Rashid 4 (8m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14,Pat Cummins
"full toss, and bowled! Zampa didn't fancy staying in line one little bit, gave himself room, and was in no position to protect his timbers as Wood splattered his off pole!",254/9,379504,46.4, b Wood 0 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Adam Zampa
