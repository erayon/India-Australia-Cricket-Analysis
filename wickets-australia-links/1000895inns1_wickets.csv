"carved away in the air. It dies in front of point, but Azam bends forward and snaps up a low catch. He claims it, and they go upstairs. It's a clean catch and a cramping David Warner walks back for 179, his best ODI score. No double-hundred for him, though. Slower short ball, cuts away from Warner. He reaches out for the ball and scythes it in the air. The opening stand ends on 284",284/1,219889,41.3,c Babar Azam b Junaid Khan 179 (186m 128b 19x4 5x6) SR: 139.84,David Warner
"Swatted away in the air. Wahab tracks the ball from mid-on, runs to his right, and plucks the overhead catch. But on impact his <b>right knee got jarred in the turf</b>. He collapses and winces in pain. Banged in short and outside off head-hunting ball, too high for a hook. Smith flat-bats it in the air and holes out",288/2,267192,41.5,c Wahab Riaz b Junaid Khan 4 (3m 2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200.00,Steven Smith
"Maxwell hits it flat and hard to Hafeez at sweeper cover.  Full and outside off, Maxwell simply shovels it in the air with the bottom hand to the man in the deep. Dolly catch",323/3,325026,44.5,c Mohammad Hafeez b Mohammad Amir 13 (16m 7b 1x4 1x6) SR: 185.71,Glenn Maxwell
"slower ball from Hasan. Full and cuts away from the left-hander. Wade aims to loft it, possibly down the ground. Ends up slicing a catch to sweeper cover",336/4,230193,46.2,c Shoaib Malik b Hasan Ali 8 (8m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33,Matthew Wade
"Juggles and takes it on the third attempt. Azhar has a wry smile. Head walks back for 128, acknowledging the applause at his home ground. Full and angling away outside off, Head eyes a leg-side slog, ends up skying an overhead catch to long-off. Azhar hangs onto it.... just",342/5,530011,46.4,c Azhar Ali b Hasan Ali 128 (219m 137b 9x4 3x6) SR: 93.43,Travis Head
"slower short ball on the leg stump, Handscomb does not get enough power behind the pull. He can't manufacture his own pace. Holes out to Hafeez at deep square leg running across to his left. Wahab finishes with a wicket. He has done fairly well today even as his colleagues crashed and burned",351/6,334337,47.6,c Mohammad Hafeez b Wahab Riaz 1 (10m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Peter Handscomb
"very full and outside off, shovelled with the bottom hand to wide long-on. Starc and Faulkner push on for the second. Nice, flat throw from the deep to Rizwan who breaks the stumps and catches Starc short",367/7,311592,49.4,run out (&dagger;Mohammad Rizwan/Shoaib Malik) 6 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 120.00,Mitchell Starc
