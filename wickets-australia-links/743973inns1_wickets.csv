"gone this time. Shortish length on middle, Burns picks the length early and wants to pull over square leg but gets a thick top edge which flies in the air with no distance. Niall gets under it and takes a comfortable catch. The umpires take a look at the front line again but this time he is behind the line.",139/1,326632,21.5,c &dagger;O'Brien b Young 69 (91m 70b 7x4 1x6) SR: 98.57,Joe Burns
"wicket for Murtagh. Warner fails to time the pull well this time. Another missed century fro Warner on this tour. Shortish length on middle, Warner attempts to pull over square leg again, hits it decently though but in the air. He doesn't get all of it and goes down to deep square leg who takes a good running catch.",165/2,219889,27.4,c Joyce b Murtagh 84 (112m 80b 7x4 3x6) SR: 105.00,David Warner
the pressure tells. The lines and lengths work to perfection. Pitches on a good length and comes back in just a tad. Any guesses where it was directed? The ball takes the top of off and Aus are now three down. Bailey wanted to work it behind square on the off side but a little bit of nip accounted for him.,167/3,4451,29.2, b Murtagh 1 (8m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28,George Bailey
"and another one goes. Maxwell is gone. Ireland coming back into it now. Flat and quick outside off, a nothing delivery actually. Maxwell lazily stays in his crease, looking to punch through the off side but he gets a thick outside edge, which is extremely well taken by Niall. Big deflection.",170/4,325026,30.2,c &dagger;O'Brien b McBrine 2 (4m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Glenn Maxwell
"edged and taken. Ireland get the big wicket of Steven Smith. Great, reflex catch by Niall. Shortish length outside off, Smith looks to guide down to third man or punch it wide of point but gets a thick outside edge which flies towards Niall who dives very nicely low to his right to hang on to a stunner.",190/5,267192,35.2,c &dagger;O'Brien b Thompson 21 (51m 38b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.26,Steven Smith
"straight up in the air and taken. marsh goes now. Mooney cleverly delivers it from wider of the crease with a bit of leg cut, Marsh looks to hit over long-off again but the change in point of delivery helps taking the outer half of the bat. Murtagh settles under it and takes a good catch.",214/6,272450,39.1,c Murtagh b Mooney 11 (15m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 73.33,Mitchell Marsh
