"gone. Whoa. Some start this. Full and wide outside off, not a lot of swing but enough. Fletcher wafts at it aimlessly and the skew flies to backward point. Comfortable height and comfortably taken. Starc has a wicket in his first over on international return",6/1,51862,0.5,c Maxwell b Starc 4 (6m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Andre Fletcher
"poor shot. Full and wide, Bravo lays into a drive but fails to keep it down. Hits an uppish drive but straight to extra cover who juggles it and then takes it inches away from the ground. Not sure what he was trying to do there, maybe through the stroke too early",50/2,277472,11.1,c Zampa b Marsh 19 (46m 31b 3x4 0x6) SR: 61.29,Darren Bravo
"bowled im. That's why he was brought back. Charles' struggling innings ends. A superb yorker again, not for the first time Charles gets an inside edge but this time it rattled into middle stump. Late swing back in. Superb stuff from Starc",59/3,333066,13.1, b Starc 22 (64m 40b 1x4 1x6) SR: 55.00,Johnson Charles
"given this time by umpire Brathwaite. Flat on middle and leg, skids on with the arm. The ball thuds into Samuels' pads in front of leg. This time the finger goes up. Samuels went deep in his crease but just missed his flick. Umpire's call at best/worst so a good decision not to review",70/4,52983,16.1,lbw b Lyon 10 (28m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 71.42,Marlon Samuels
"straight to long-on. Pollard falls. Australia have two in two. Lyon has two in two. The same shot that got WI out of trouble in the previous game causes further misery for WI here. Tossed up on middle, some spin takes the inside half of Pollard's bat who looked to go down the ground with an uppish loft. That turn helped the ball lands straight in Warner's lap at long-on",70/5,230559,16.2,c Warner b Lyon 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Kieron Pollard
"an appeal for lbw, Maxi gets it to straighten, given! Pushed on middle, Ramdin presses forward and plays across the line and is trapped in front. Rapped on the front pad. No inside snick involved. Ump Brathwaite's call is vindicated. <b>Ramdin's review amounts to nothing</b>. The tracker shows it would hit middle. Maxi leaves the hosts six down",85/6,52917,22.2,lbw b Maxwell 12 (40m 30b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Denesh Ramdin
bowled 'em! Holder rocks away outside leg and exposes all three stumps. Zampa takes aim and locks his target. He fires a slider and takes the off stump. The hosts are seven down,88/7,391485,23.4, b Zampa 1 (5m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66,Jason Holder
"Soft, soft dismissal. Khawaja pats Lyon on the head. Looped up on middle, may have stopped a touch on Benn. He has to check his push-drive, he ends up plopping it back to Lyon",91/8,51248,26.1,c &amp; b Lyon 3 (12m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85,Sulieman Benn
"wrong'un and Zampa strikes again! Narine showed his ace early by dancing out. Zampa dangles a googly outside off, got it to dip as well. Narine aimed a hack across the line and did not touch it. Wade flips the bails off",111/9,230558,30.4,st &dagger;Wade b Zampa 5 (18m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.50,Sunil Narine
"floated on off, 79ks Ricky has a big swing at it. He does not get under it. He has to settle with a sliced hit. Finch pouches it at the edge of the long-on boundary",116/10,457249,32.3,c Finch b Zampa 21 (69m 48b 1x4 1x6) SR: 43.75,Carlos Brathwaite
