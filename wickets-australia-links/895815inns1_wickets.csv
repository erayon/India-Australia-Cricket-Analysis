"given! What a delivery that is. Ducks back in prodigiously to hit Finch outside the line of off stump. But he wasn't offering a stroke. Umpire Kettleborough had no hesitation and raised his finger immediately but did that nip back in enough? Lots of swing for Ishant, the first time we have seen as much in this series.",6/1,5334,0.6,lbw b I Sharma 6 (4m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Aaron Finch
"very poor shot. Bumrah gets his first wicket. Smith picks out midwicket. Short delivery on off, Smith plays a nothing pull straight o short midwicket. Bumrah is jubilant. Big big wicket for India, this could put Australia behind the 8-ball for a while.",64/2,267192,11.5,c RG Sharma b Bumrah 28 (47m 37b 3x4 0x6) SR: 75.67,Steven Smith
"taken. Another wicket. Another big wicket. Legcutter on middle, taking the pace off the delivery and Bailey looks to turn to the leg side. The ball stops in the wicket and aids in taking the leading edge. Ishant at mid-on runs around and takes a dolly.",78/3,4451,14.5,c I Sharma b R Dhawan 6 (13m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85,George Bailey
"Marsh may be gone. This will be a huge wicket. marsh is gone. What a fortunate dismissal that is for India. Short outside off, Warner crashes a cut to deep point. And calls Marsh through. The throw is not very good, bounces just in front of Gurkeerat. The ball hits the knee of Gurkeerat and then ricochets onto the stumps to find Marsh short. Could be a massive moment in this game",117/4,6683,21.2,run out (Yadav/Gurkeerat Singh) 7 (30m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Shaun Marsh
"gone! That was the slower ball, back of a length on off stump, and Warner backs away to manufacture room to cut. No pace on it, and the sliced uppercut drops towards backward point, where Jadeja takes a simple catch while falling to his right",235/5,219889,38.5,c Jadeja b I Sharma 122 (171m 113b 9x4 3x6) SR: 107.96,David Warner
"got him. That's a fullish ball slanting away wide of off stump. Wade looked to thrash his arms through it, having taken a big step back to shorten the length, and only succeeds in top-edging to Dhoni",320/6,230193,47.3,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 36 (39m 27b 2x4 1x6) SR: 133.33,Matthew Wade
"oh, Bumrah, what a delivery. Takes out Faulkner's off stump with a perfect yorker that the batsman plays all around",323/7,270484,48.1, b Bumrah 1 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,James Faulkner
