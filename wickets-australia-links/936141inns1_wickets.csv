"bowled im. One down already. Too exuberant from Finch. But a beautiful delivery too. The perfect delivery to Finch, akin to Southee's ball against Finch in Auckland. Full, just outside off, and so Finch thinks he can hit on the up. But the ball jags back just enough to go through a massive gap between bat and pad. Sends the off stump for a walk. Magnificent start for SA.",2/1,5334,0.3, b Abbott 2 (1m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Aaron Finch
"one more. Abbott has another. What a jaffa. Australia's openers have been bowled in 13 balls. Continues to be full on off and middle, but this tails back exaggeratedly. Goes through a gap between bat and pad again, and disturbs the stumps. Warner visibly late in picking the movement. Superb start from Abbott.",9/2,219889,2.1, b Abbott 6 (10m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 120.00,David Warner
"Bailey gone now. Australia in all sorts. Bailey doesn't review, and rightly so. Plumb in front. Good length on off and middle. Bailey sees the length and stays back, but should have come forward because of the variable bounce. It keeps low, jags back in and pins Bailey plumb in front. Didn't have much chance once he hung on that back foot",12/3,4451,3.2,lbw b Pretorius 1 (4m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66,George Bailey
"<strong>quite close. </strong>Big appeal, but too much doubt, I'd say. Faf and his close fielders have a chat, and he <strong>decides to review</strong>. Nice flight outside off from Shamsi, it turns back in and hits Smith in front of off. This could be closer than I thought initially. No bat. Umpire's call? rRemember, there is a new lbw protocol. in force. Those new lbw rules aren't needed because it struck him in front of off and hits off and middle. All reds on hawkeye. The umpire overturns his decision. The key to that lbw was just a little bit of spin that helped the ball turn past Smith's bat. He played forward, but just missed it. A bit of movement does for another Australia batsman.",49/4,267192,14.4,lbw b Shamsi 21 (61m 36b 2x4 0x6) SR: 58.33,Steven Smith
"one more! Shamsi has two in three. Another one for SA. Head has a chat with his partner and opts not to review. Australia in tatters now. Another orthodox delivery, flat on off. The ball spins a touch and beats Head's outside edge to strike him in front of off. Was there too much spin? Would it have been umpire's call? Head did not pick either delivery. Australia have been left befuddled by a few deliveries that have moved, similar to their troubles against spin in Sri Lanka. This ain't looking good now. All reds on hawkeye, good call not to review",49/5,530011,14.6,lbw b Shamsi 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Travis Head
"gone! Abbott returns to an impeccable length and line, and reaps a reward immediately. Massive wicket, massive moment in the game. Just goes slightly wide of the crease, a fuller than good length outside off. Marsh pokes and gets a thick outside edge to de Kock. Superb bowling. Big big breakthrough. Quality knock but could have done more",111/6,272450,27.4,c &dagger;de Kock b Abbott 50 (101m 72b 5x4 1x6) SR: 69.44,Mitchell Marsh
"Shamsi returns and strikes! Tossed up nicely and spins back into the right-hander. Hastings has a short stride as he looks to defend with a straight bat. He, however, looks to defend outside the line. Shami beats him on the inside and raps the front pad below the knee-roll in front of middle. The finger goes up, and Hastings knew he was gone. Din't bother to review. The tracker shows that it would take the leg stump!",116/7,228622,28.2,lbw b Shamsi 4 (5m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33,John Hastings
bowled 'em! The off stump is floored. What a sight for a fast bowler! Good-length ball angled into the right-hander. Then straightens and beats the skittish waft of Zampa. Abbott barges into Zampa's castle and takes him down. The batsman was probably aiming to run the ball through vacant slip. No dice...,121/8,379504,29.2, b Abbott 5 (4m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125.00,Adam Zampa
"Phangiso belts out an appeal for lbw, it's given! Wade wants a <b>review</b>, more out of hope rather than conviction. He's also Australia's last hope. Pushed through from over the wicket, starts outside off, and spins in. Wade goes low for the sweep and misses. Struck on the thigh in line with the stumps. The tracker shows it would hit the leg stump",167/9,230193,36.1,lbw b Phangiso 52 (96m 58b 5x4 2x6) SR: 89.65,Matthew Wade
"Phangiso strikes the pad, again! Draws another leg-before appeal. The bowler isn't sure. <b>Qdk insists on a review</b>, and Faf goes for it. Inside edge? Replays show pad first! Tossed up full, drifts in. Straightens enough. It would have hit middle. <strong>Australia have been dismissed for 167</strong>",167/10,446548,36.4,lbw b Phangiso 0 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Scott Boland
