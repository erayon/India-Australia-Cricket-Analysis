"there's the first wicket and it's plumb. Hafeez slaps his pad in disappointment. He plays all around a full incoming delivery on middle and misses. Hazlewood didn't even bother appealing till very late because he knew Hafeez was stone dead there. Respite for Australia after a pulsating start. Hafeez fell over and when he did so, the leg stump was visible. An umpire needs no more proof",36/1,41434,4.1,lbw b Hazlewood 4 (18m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.76,Mohammad Hafeez
"the party is over! Sharjeel looks to cut again, this time it was too close for him to play that. The drift in ensured he only managed a thick inside edge back onto the stumps. Celebration one delivery, frustration the next.",85/2,227762,15.6, b Head 50 (70m 47b 8x4 1x6) SR: 106.38,Sharjeel Khan
"GONE! Grade cricket batting that. Head loops it across him outside off, he steps out early, gets beaten in flight and doesn't know what to do with it next. Flails at it as it keeps drifting away and he can only get a top-edge, straight to short third man",99/3,316397,19.6,c Khawaja b Head 5 (14m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Asad Shafiq
"GONE! 134 kph, good length in the corridor, and his poor feet movement have finally done him. Pushes at it with hard hands and gets a healthy outside edge. Wade takes it easily and that's Stanlake's first wicket in ODIs",162/4,42657,30.3,c &dagger;Wade b Stanlake 39 (40m 41b 3x4 1x6) SR: 95.12,Shoaib Malik
"that's an outstanding catch by Handscomb. The pressure has got to Babar, who looks to pull that in front of square. Doesn't get the elevation. Handscomb, running in from deep midwicket, had to take a split-second decision if he wants to go for the catch or risk conceding a boundary. He takes a couple of steps forward and then dives low and full length forward to complete a super catch. Gets his fingers completely underneath the ball even as it was dying. The third umpire has a look, but Babar is walking off.",222/5,348144,42.1,c Handscomb b Hazlewood 84 (157m 100b 4x4 1x6) SR: 84.00,Babar Azam
"reward for some super bowling. Sees the batsman advancing and hits the deck hard. The bouncer is too steep for Akmal, who can only glove it to the keeper in an attempt to run it down to third man. Another setback for Pakistan just when Akmal was looking good to eye a final flourish",244/6,317273,45.3,c &dagger;Wade b Hazlewood 39 (65m 51b 1x4 1x6) SR: 76.47,Umar Akmal
"slapped over the infield, but that is an outstanding catch by Travis Head running backwards from mid-off. He had to be mindful of Maxwell running from cover, but the loud and clear call allowed him to back off. Having made the early call, aided by a head start, he kept his eyes on the ball and then flung himself forward to complete the catch. Never easy taking those, especially when you're running backwards, but wow, did he pull off a stunner or what. Pakistan are crumbling here after setting themselves up for a 300 plus total",246/7,227758,46.1,c Head b Cummins 9 (21m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 69.23,Imad Wasim
