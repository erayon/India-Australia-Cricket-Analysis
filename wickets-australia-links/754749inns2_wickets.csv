"skies it! Raina calls for it immediately and yells in delight after completing a soft dismissal. It was short of a good length, but Warner's front foot press works against him. Then he decided to play a sort of a pull shot when there wasn't much room. Ends up spooning a simple catch at extra cover, which was well taken.",51/1,219889,9.1,c Raina b Yadav 24 (41m 22b 3x4 0x6) SR: 109.09,David Warner
"slugs across the line and yells at himself as his off stump is knocked back. The Dhoni mantra works, reduce the runs, limit the boundaries and lure the mistake. Good, tight bowling from the left-arm darter",115/2,8180,22.4, b Patel 41 (47m 39b 5x4 1x6) SR: 105.12,Shane Watson
"oops, he's swatted a slower bouncer right at short midwicket! Played with total control for the length of his innings but Shami did well to get enough height behind that ball to foil Smith's timing",216/3,267192,39.4,c Ashwin b Mohammed Shami 47 (66m 52b 6x4 0x6) SR: 90.38,Steven Smith
nicks to the keeper! Finch misses out on a hundred on his home ground. Looks to force a short ball that seems to gain a bit more bounce than he expected. Feather through the keeper gives India a bit of a boost,219/4,5334,40.1,c &dagger;Dhoni b Yadav 96 (161m 127b 5x4 2x6) SR: 75.59,Aaron Finch
"has he done it? Yes! Beautiful stumping! Good length ball sliding down leg, Bailey attempts a flick and overbalances and that fraction of a second is enough for Dhoni to jump across and flick the bails. Oh, and HotSpot says there was a nick in there too so it is actually a catch",230/5,4451,43.2,c &dagger;Dhoni b Ashwin 5 (12m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 45.45,George Bailey
"slower ball! Taken! Maxi has been sent back by a legcutter. He had been rushing down the track, has to adjust. Attempts a flick and gets it quite high on the bat to lob a simple catch back at the bowler.",248/6,325026,46.3,c &amp; b Kumar 20 (34m 23b 1x4 1x6) SR: 86.95,Glenn Maxwell
