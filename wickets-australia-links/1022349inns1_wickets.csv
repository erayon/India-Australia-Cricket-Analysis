"there's the breakthrough! A bit of seam movement and extra bounce. Chose the wrong ball to flick through leg, and took a leading edge straight to point. A fine innings cut short by the wrong shot at the wrong time",40/1,226492,5.4,c Maxwell b Hazlewood 26 (27m 22b 5x4 0x6) SR: 118.18,Martin Guptill
"picks the bones out of that but picks out Maxwell at point. The party is over. The ball deviates a wee bit from length, it seemed as if Ronchi wanted to hit it to the right of point, but ended up slicing it instead because of the minute deviation off the deck. Relief for Australia",117/2,7502,15.4,c Maxwell b Hastings 65 (72m 43b 9x4 3x6) SR: 151.16,Luke Ronchi
"there's the wicket! A cross-seam delivery, pace off the ball, Taylor climbs into an ambitious yahoo, but that is a spiralling top-edge, easily pocketed in the covers",216/3,38699,33.5,c Henriques b Hastings 46 (76m 58b 6x4 0x6) SR: 79.31,Ross Taylor
"wide of off stump, tapped down the ground, and is going to be a run-out at the non-strikers' end. Yes, it is! Williamson was stranded as Cummins gathered and unleashed from a yard out, and that's the end of a fantastic innings",254/4,277906,39.1,run out (Henriques/Cummins) 100 (148m 97b 8x4 3x6) SR: 103.09,Kane Williamson
"hoisted high and hard, but only as far as Glenn Maxwell on the midwicket rope! Broom is heading back to the cupboard, and New Zealand are in danger of dribbling to a sub-300 total",257/5,36581,40.1,c Maxwell b Hazlewood 14 (33m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 73.68,Neil Broom
"another ambitious wipe, but this time it's simply spanged high into the off side. Who wants it? No-one really, but Henriques is the closest at backward point, clinging onto a steepler inches from the turf as he just about judges it in time!",267/6,277662,41.5,c Henriques b Cummins 8 (8m 5b 0x4 1x6) SR: 160.00,Corey Anderson
stand and deliver... deliver it straight to mid-on. Not the shot the circumstances required. New Zealand are sinking badly in the slog overs. They might struggle to use their full allocation at this rate,270/7,355269,42.2,c Warner b Hazlewood 6 (17m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,James Neesham
"another supreme connection, but straight to Maxwell on the rope! He utterly smoked that pull, but some you win, some you lose",291/8,450860,44.3,c Maxwell b Hazlewood 11 (3m 7b 2x4 0x6) SR: 157.14,Adam Milne
"drilled into the covers, Smith reaches high, and Hazlewood has a five-for with his second in a row!",291/9,502714,44.4,c Smith b Hazlewood 8 (11m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 114.28,Mitchell Santner
"edged and gone! Hazlewood wraps up the innings with 6 for 52, a perfect Test-match line and length, kissing the edge of the No.11. What a regrouping from Australia. They'll be firm favourites when the chase gets underway shortly",291/10,277912,44.6,c &dagger;Wade b Hazlewood 0 (m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Trent Boult
