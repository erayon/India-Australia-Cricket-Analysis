"taken this time! And Australia get Sharjeel. A length delivery outside off, fourth-stump channel. Sharjeel lets the ball come to him, looking for one down to third man off the open face but the ball kisses the outside edge and is easily held by Wade. Sharjeel looking for something too cheeky, that's not his strength.",68/1,227762,14.3,c &dagger;Wade b Faulkner 29 (64m 32b 4x4 0x6) SR: 90.62,Sharjeel Khan
"taken! Not a percentage stroke with third man in place. Back of a length outside off, Azam plays that nicely, sways away from the line, arches his back and gets underneath the ball. Ramps the ball but can't get it over slip, more over gully, and because of that, third man is able to get around and complete a good catch at the third man boundary. May have been a better option to hit that over point.",140/2,348144,30.3,c Hazlewood b Starc 34 (75m 49b 5x4 0x6) SR: 69.38,Babar Azam
"fuller ball outside off, Hafeez perishes trying to play across the line. Looks to loft it and the bat face closes in his hand as he goes through with the shot. Can't get any sort of distance as the ball balloons only as far as mid-on where Hazlewood snaffles it",142/3,41434,31.5,c Hazlewood b Faulkner 72 (148m 104b 8x4 0x6) SR: 69.23,Mohammad Hafeez
"that's Shafiq gone. Extremely poor shot. Full and wide from Starc, the ball was moving away. He had  o reason to play with this being Starc's last over. Shafiq, though, wanted to drive through cover. Ended up stretching out for the ball, but it was too wide. Had no control, no balance and got a thick outside edge to Wade",195/4,316397,42.5,c &dagger;Wade b Starc 13 (61m 29b 0x4 0x6) SR: 44.82,Asad Shafiq
