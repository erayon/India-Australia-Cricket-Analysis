"oh, dear! Picks out square leg on the flick. It was a good length ball and Latham used the angle well to flick it. Timed it to perfection but could not place it as he would have liked. The ball goes straight to Faulkner at square leg. Simple catch and Latham's promising innings comes to an end",44/1,388802,8.6,c Faulkner b Cummins 28 (38m 36b 3x4 0x6) SR: 77.77,Tom Latham
"and the on-field decision stays. It was a short of good length ball that was angling. Williamson moved across to get outside the line of the ball and flick it away to the leg side. But he perhaps moved away too much and ended up playing around the pad and the ball hits the front pad. Nigel Llong raised his finger but Williamson reviews it. Only way this can get overturned is if the angle takes it down leg. It is quite sharp but it seems as though it will be umpire's call. In fact, it's hitting the inside of the leg stump",74/2,277906,13.6,lbw b Faulkner 13 (21m 12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 108.33,Kane Williamson
"oh, what a catch! It's Bailey this time. Didn't fling himself full length like Smith in the previous match, but it was a remarkable catch nonetheless and very tough. It was fuller outside and Guptill could not keep his drive along the ground. The ball lobs over the head of Bailey at short cover and he leaps up to snaffle it. Timed his jump to perfection and his back formed an almost uncomfortable arch as he took it. Guptill is livid. New Zealand now need to be careful",79/3,226492,15.1,c Bailey b Head 34 (66m 40b 3x4 0x6) SR: 85.00,Martin Guptill
"oh, gone. That's the perfect yorker. There aren't too many bowlers in world cricket today who bowl that delivery better than Starc. It was an attacking line and on the stumps. Nicholls was looking to bring his bat down to squeeze it out but the ball swings in late to beat the bat and rattle leg stump",83/4,539511,16.6, b Starc 3 (16m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 27.27,Henry Nicholls
"an appeal for lbw, not given. Did it straighten enough? It may have pitched outside leg. Smith and Head converge and challenge the on-field call. RTS does not detect an inside edge. It pitched in line, hitting off stump. Three reds flash on the big screen. Umpire Llong's on-field call is reversed. Watling attempted to sweep again, but made no contact this time",98/5,38924,21.5,lbw b Head 8 (17m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 61.53,BJ Watling
"Head probably was late to pick up the ball. He runs in from deep square leg, dives forward, and pouches it. It jams the fingers under the ball; Head clings onto it nevertheless. Clean catch. NZ six down and sinking. Dug in short and outside off, De Grandhomme swivels on the back foot. Pulls and miscues it to the fielder",113/6,55395,24.4,c Head b Hazlewood 11 (14m 10b 0x4 1x6) SR: 110.00,Colin de Grandhomme
"rip-roaring reverse-swinging yorker. Late inward shape for the fast bowler. Clatters into the leg stump. Every time Smith wants to break the stand, he turns to Starc, and his bowler delivers.  Munro attempts a whip or a drive, and is beaten for pace. The ball shot through even before the left-hander could bring his bat down",126/7,232359,28.2, b Starc 20 (53m 38b 1x4 0x6) SR: 52.63,Colin Munro
"not quite a yorker, very full and reverses in, Santner plays down the wrong line, and is beaten for pace too. Trapped in front of middle",139/8,502714,30.6,lbw b Starc 15 (25m 21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 71.42,Mitchell Santner
Southee's chancy stay comes to and end with a miscue to extra cover. It was the slower ball and Southee was forward looking for a big hit over long-off. The lack of pace means he does not get the timing right and he skews it off the high end of the bat to Warner who settles under it at extra cover,143/9,232364,33.4,c Warner b Faulkner 4 (23m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57,Tim Southee
"oh, what a way to finish! It's Smith again. Took a stunner in the previous game. This one's as good if not better than the one in the previous ODI. He dived to his left on that occasion; this time, flings himself full-length to his right to snaffle a blinder at second slip. It was a slower back of a length ball from Cummins and Boult backs away and looks to open the face of his bat to steer it. Gets himself into an awkward position and skews it off a healthy outside edge",147/10,277912,36.1,c Smith b Cummins 1 (13m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28,Trent Boult
