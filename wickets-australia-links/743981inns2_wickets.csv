"nearly a tangle, but the catch is taken! Burns aiming to flick through the leg side, gets a leading edge towards mid-off. Roy came across from cover and almost collides with Morgan, but they just avoid a collision and the captain holds on",33/1,326632,6.1,c Morgan b Finn 9 (26m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Joe Burns
"what a catch! Finn at short midwicket. Unusual position for him, but he's used his reach to great effect. Smith down the pitch, aimed a flick through the leg side, Finn flings himself to his right - almost horizontal - sticks out his right hand and holds a blinder. Jonty Rhodes and Ben Stokes would have been proud.",75/2,267192,15.5,c Finn b Rashid 25 (37m 33b 3x4 0x6) SR: 75.75,Steven Smith
"Finch tries to tee off... and hits it straight up and down into the safe hands of Woakes running in from long-on! Rashid has a second, he's been a struggle to score off and Finch was trying to break the shackles, a moment of Hulk-like violence but he is soon slinking off looking more like Bruce Banner",106/3,5334,21.4,c Woakes b Rashid 53 (86m 60b 8x4 0x6) SR: 88.33,Aaron Finch
"tries a reverse dab this time, a top edge loops up and Bairstow takes a simple catch! Umpire Wilson slowly raises his finger and although Maxwell looks disgusted it is probably with the shot rather than the decision. It was more of a poke where the previous two attempts went fully through with the shot and the ball spooned off the toe, hit the arm and Bairstow didn't have far to go to complete the catch",128/4,325026,26.3,c &dagger;Bairstow b Ali 17 (16m 12b 3x4 0x6) SR: 141.66,Glenn Maxwell
"full toss from Moeen, clubbed to leg... but straight to the fielder at deep midwicket! Bailey can't believe it but England are delighted, he came down the pitch and heaved a rank delivery down the throat of Stokes as he came in off the rope",141/5,4451,28.5,c Stokes b Ali 25 (46m 42b 0x4 0x6) SR: 59.52,George Bailey
"slightly back of a length, Marsh shovels it off his hips.... straight to midwicket! Another one goes, Marsh having to make the disconsolate trudge back to the changing rooms. Australia in the doo-doo now",154/6,272450,33.6,c Woakes b Plunkett 13 (27m 26b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Mitchell Marsh
"amazing! Roy holds what turns into a screamer. Agar launched this miles into the night sky and into the lights. Roy steadies himself at long on, but slightly misjudges it and the ball spills out as he falls backwards but, astonishingly, he is able to hold the rebound before the ball falls to the ground. A touch of fortune, yes, but some mind-boggling reflexes and awareness",165/7,505120,37.6,c Roy b Plunkett 5 (16m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Ashton Agar
"what lovely bowling! Pitches on off stump, spins, and takes Starc's outside edge as he drives...neat catch from Bairstow",167/8,311592,38.5,c &dagger;Bairstow b Ali 1 (2m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Mitchell Starc
another catch for Roy...much more regulation. Cummins lofts a length delivery right down his throat at long-on,172/9,489889,39.4,c Roy b Plunkett 5 (3m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Pat Cummins
"and that's all over! Down the pitch, swings to leg against a length delivery, misses and gets cleaned up",207/10,230193,43.6, b Finn 42 (60m 41b 5x4 0x6) SR: 102.43,Matthew Wade
