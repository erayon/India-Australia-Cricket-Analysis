"full and angled in to catch the pad from round the stumps. Qdk flicks and misses/may have tickled it. The umpire - Wilson - gives it as runs. Smith has a chat with Wade and goes for a review. The on-field call is not out. I can't spot an inside snick. There isn't enough evidence actually. There was a noise, but it probably came from the ball hitting the front pad and then the back pad. Impact in line, the tracker shows that it would have hit the leg stump. Umpire Wilson's call is reversed. TV umpire Llong rules it out. Coach Domingo and debutant Shami look puzzled in the SA change room. Qdk has to go, though. Australia get the breakthrough!",29/1,379143,6.3,lbw b Hazlewood 18 (32m 23b 2x4 1x6) SR: 78.26,Quinton de Kock
"Rossouw presses forward and has been given out lbw by ump Illingworth. Looks adjacent. No inside snick there. Rossouw reviews. Not a good one. <strong>South Africa have lost their review</strong>. Another one that straightens, fuller in length, hit in front of middle. He pushed forward and did not touch it. The on-field call is vindicated",41/2,318845,9.5,lbw b Lyon 7 (14m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 63.63,Rilee Rossouw
"gone! Fantastic fielding from Steven Smith. Manufactures a wicket, and a massive one too. Amla run-out again. A darter outside off is punched to the left of Smith, who runs around and stops it in one swift motion. He has the presence of mind to realise it is Amla who is halfway down and returns a good throw to Finch who takes off the bails. Big, big, big, big wicket",81/3,43906,18.1,run out (Smith/Finch) 35 (81m 46b 2x4 0x6) SR: 76.08,Hashim Amla
"bowled im. Massive wicket. AB is gone. Full on off, tails back in just enough to beat AB's bat. He tried to open the face to guide to third man but the ball jagged back just enough to go through his defences. Huge wicket this.",97/4,44936,22.1, b Coulter-Nile 22 (48m 38b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.89,AB de Villiers
"bowled im. SA in tatters. NCN again. An absolute beauty. Not much he could have done actually. A good length delivery on off, straightens just enough to beat Duminy's bat. Uproots off stump. NCN defeated AB with one that jagged back in, beats Duminy with the away going one. Splendid bowling",104/5,44932,24.6, b Coulter-Nile 13 (26m 22b 0x4 0x6) SR: 59.09,Jean-Paul Duminy
"got im. One more. Another batsman's off stump goes for a jolly walk. Kept very low. Full on off, Parnell presses forward to that and planted his bat down the line but the ball pitched and kept low enough to creep under the bat. Clattered into off stump. SA six down",112/6,265564,28.2, b Hazlewood 2 (13m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22,Wayne Parnell
Phangiso goes for another wild heave. He makes a mess of it and holes out to long-off. Tosses a legbreak. The batsman goes low for a slog-sweep. He skews it into the hands of Hazlewood. FB shakes his head at the non-striker's end,149/7,46942,41.3,c Hazlewood b Zampa 9 (50m 41b 0x4 0x6) SR: 21.95,Aaron Phangiso
"bowled'em. End of a fighting innings from FB. Tossed full and straight, FB bends for a reverse paddle. He misses and is nutmegged. Timbaaaah!",188/8,44410,49.4, b Maxwell 62 (109m 82b 4x4 1x6) SR: 75.60,Farhaan Behardien
Tahir out! He runs down the track right away and runs out to the change room. He swings and slices it down the throat of NCN at long-off,188/9,40618,49.5,c Coulter-Nile b Maxwell 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Imran Tahir
