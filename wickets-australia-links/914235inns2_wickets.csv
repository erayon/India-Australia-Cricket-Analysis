"he's been caught at cover! the ball was nothing special, short of a length and angling into him, Warner was on the back foot to punch over cover but the ball stopped on him a bit and he ended up spooning it straight to Elliott",39/1,219889,4.6,c Elliott b Henry 16 (19m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 114.28,David Warner
"caught behind! Khawaja stays on his crease with feet rather stationary and drives loosely away from his body at a length ball that seams away from him, a thick edge and Ronchi dives to his left to take the catch, rather like how Nicholls got out",75/2,215155,11.2,c &dagger;Ronchi b Bracewell 44 (46m 36b 4x4 2x6) SR: 122.22,Usman Khawaja
"lbw! Smith does not like the decision and he is going to have a word with Bailey. They are reviewing this one. Smith was a long way on the front foot, down on one knee as he tried to sweep that ball. There was no edge and that ball is going straight on to hit the stumps",94/3,267192,18.4,lbw b Sodhi 21 (56m 35b 1x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Steven Smith
"Sodhi has broken open this game! Maxwell pushes with hard hands away from his body at a legbreak pitched on a good length outside off, thick outside edge caught by McCullum at first slip",94/4,325026,18.6,c McCullum b Sodhi 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Glenn Maxwell
"bowled him! Marsh has been hitting it like a dream but Bailey pokes tentatively at a short of a length ball that nips into him from outside off and gets an inside edge on to his stumps. Is there life in this New Zealand defence? 50 wickets for Henry at an average of 22. He's got there in his 23rd game, behind only Ajantha Mendis",153/5,4451,29.5, b Henry 33 (74m 60b 3x4 0x6) SR: 55.00,George Bailey
"Henry thinks that ball has come straight off the boot and back to him, he half appeals for a catch. And that should be enough for an appeal and now the umpires are talking to each other. Henry bowled one right in the blockhole and Marsh jammed his bat down on it. I think that was hit into the ground and the boot. But Henry thought it was right off the boot and after ages the umpires decide to go to the third umpire. <b>And would you believe it, that has gone right off the inside edge right on to the toe of the boot and back to Henry, who got down low in his follow through to take the catch</b>, Marsh is out and Seddon Park explodes in a huge cheer. What a stroke of luck for New Zealand.",164/6,272450,33.4,c &amp; b Henry 41 (58m 42b 4x4 1x6) SR: 97.61,Mitchell Marsh
"the Hairy Javelin has caught it at deep square leg, running in from the boundary! Anderson peppered Hastings with another bouncer, it got big on him as he tried to hook, dragging the ball against the angle across him from over the wicket, the top edge was never going to clear the boundary and Elliott ran it and judged it well enough. New Zealand edge ahead in the chase!",179/7,228622,38.1,c Elliott b Anderson 6 (23m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 31.57,John Hastings
"short ball, pulled straight at Guptill on the edge of the circle at midwicket! Actually that was not straight at him, he had to take a few quick steps to his left and dive to catch it. Wade hit that firmly but placed it i the vicinity of one of the most agile catchers in the game",184/8,230193,39.6,c Guptill b Milne 17 (49m 26b 1x4 0x6) SR: 65.38,Matthew Wade
"edged and this time McCullum dives forward at first slip to catch it close to the ground! Zampa pushes from his crease away from his body at a good length ball that seams across him, the last time it fell short to McCullum's left, this time he dives forward to catch it before the ball can hit the grass!",184/9,379504,40.5,c McCullum b Anderson 2 (12m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 18.18,Adam Zampa
"that's the game! A direct hit from point has run out Boland and the Kiwis rush towards Nicholls the fielder at point! Boland backed away towards leg to steer the ball towards point and ran, Nicholls moved quickly to his right, fielded cleanly and nailed the stumps with a swift throw, Boland was a couple of feet short",191/10,446548,43.4,run out (Nicholls) 2 (11m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66,Scott Boland
