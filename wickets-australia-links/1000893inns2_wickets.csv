"Smith ventures to his left from second slip and gobbles the edge up in front of first slip. Nice and full, swings away outside off, Azhar follows the curve of the ball. Drives away from the body and nicks behind",15/1,39037,1.6,c Smith b Hazlewood 7 (9m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 70.00,Azhar Ali
"Azam holes out to long-on running to his right. Good catch from Hazlewood. That's the major difference  between the two teams. Good length and outside off, Azam drops down to one knee, attempts a slog-sweep, and skies it to Hazlewood. The bat twisted in Azam's hands, sucking all the power from the shot",88/2,348144,13.6,c Hazlewood b Head 31 (47m 39b 4x4 0x6) SR: 79.48,Babar Azam
"Sharjeel can't clear the long boundary, Warner snaps it up at the edge of the deep midwicket boundary. He lets out a big roar. Tossed up outside off, not much turn. Sharjeel goes down on one knee. Toe-ends a slog sweep. First wicket for Zampa, and that's a major blow for Pakistan",119/3,227762,16.5,c Warner b Zampa 74 (67m 47b 10x4 3x6) SR: 157.44,Sharjeel Khan
"floated in on a good length outside off, Hafeez gets slow and goes for the slog sweep, it climbs on him slightly and takes the top of the bat and carries easily to deep midwicket on that long boundary",183/4,41434,29.6,c sub (JP Faulkner) b Zampa 40 (61m 40b 3x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Mohammad Hafeez
"Warner simply loves the SCG. He runs in from deep midwicket, attacks the ball, and pockets a low catch. Excellent judgement. He then turns back towards the crowd, lets out a roar, and thumps his chest. He enjoyed that catch. That's how you do it, Pakistan. Pushed through outside off, Malik drops to one knee and skies a slog-sweep. Only toe-ended it in the air...",215/5,42657,35.5,c Warner b Head 47 (76m 61b 1x4 1x6) SR: 77.04,Shoaib Malik
"Pat Cummins calmly settles under the skier. Two wickets in two overs right after drinks. Starc digs it short and outside off. Slower bouncer. Umar has a limp pull at it, plays way early, and top-edges it into the hands of Cummins at short fine leg. Umar never really got going",218/6,317273,36.4,c Cummins b Starc 11 (35m 23b 0x4 0x6) SR: 47.82,Umar Akmal
"quick skidder from Zampa, fizzes in with the arm, beats the inside edge as Rizwan plays across the line and is pinged on the front pad above the knee-roll. The finger goes up. Nothing on Hotspot. Nothing on RTS. The tracker shows it would carry onto hit the top of leg stump. Umpire Gaffney's on-field call is vindicated. Rizwan's review in vain",245/7,323389,40.3,lbw b Zampa 10 (26m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Mohammad Rizwan
"back of a length and outside off, 141ks, Amir, having backed away, slashes again, this time edging it behind to Wade at a comfortable height",252/8,290948,41.5,c &dagger;Wade b Cummins 5 (7m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Mohammad Amir
"Imad shuffles a long way across the off stump, Hazlewood follows him with a very full ball. Imad aims to scoop it away over the keeper. Does not get enough bat on ball and ends up tickling a catch behind to Wade",267/9,227758,43.4,c &dagger;Wade b Hazlewood 25 (34m 17b 2x4 0x6) SR: 147.05,Imad Wasim
"<b>Australia beat Pakistan by 86 runs and sew up the series</b>. Junaid bags a first-ball duck. Full and swerves in slightly, breaches Junaid's defences and hits the off stump",267/10,259551,43.5, b Hazlewood 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Junaid Khan
