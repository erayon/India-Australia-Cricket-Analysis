"the angle has done the trick, de Silva has given a catch straight to mid-on! Back of length from Faulkner and angling in, de Silva didn't move much and then punched it straight to Starc at chest height. De Silva's disappointed with himself as Faulkner punched the air twice!",73/1,465793,13.5,c Starc b Faulkner 34 (59m 47b 4x4 0x6) SR: 72.34,Dhananjaya de Silva
"bowled around his legs! The second time he has attempted that shot even though the ball is headed for the stumps. This flatter delivery pitched on leg, he looks to sweep it fine by exposing his leg stump and the ball goes straight to rattle the leg sutmp as Gunathilaka misses",77/2,345821,14.5, b Zampa 39 (65m 40b 2x4 1x6) SR: 97.50,Danushka Gunathilaka
"another one, Starc has struck indeed and SL lose their third in 10 balls! He banged it in short again, Chandimal looked to guide the ball fine this time by going on his toes but he only feathers an outside edge to the keeper! Replays show it was the glove actually, the pace and bounce did him!",78/3,300628,15.2,c &dagger;Wade b Starc 1 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Dinesh Chandimal
"edged and gone! Mendis fishes at an inviting length and feathers one through. A soft dismissal after looking so good through his innings. Hastings jumps wide of the crease and bowls one on a good length outside off, Mendis' feet are rooted in the crease but he still wafts at that, gets a thin edge which is gleefully accepted by Wade",121/4,629074,23.5,c &dagger;Wade b Hastings 33 (44m 36b 5x4 1x6) SR: 91.66,Kusal Mendis
"beautifully bowled. Lots of loop and flight outside off, Tharanga drives early and away from his body, the ball stops in the surface and spins a touch. Tharanga lobs an easy catch to point off the outside half of his bat. Poor shot, but induced by some clever change in pace",129/5,50747,26.5,c Zampa b Head 15 (43m 25b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Upul Tharanga
"<strong>Kusal reviews immediately</strong>, umpire  Palliyaguruge gives him. Looked like an inside edge. Only decision for the umpire to make is if there is some bat. Seems like there is some bat. Flat on middle, this one doesn't spin. Kusal comes forward but the ball strikes the pad via the bat, right in front of off. Yes, big edge. This should be overturned. All reds on ball-tracking.  Wait, this is not overturned. Kusal shakes his head as he walks off. Baffling call, big deviation as the ball struck the pad. Third umpire Michael Gough thought otherwise, may have thought there isn't enough evidence to overturn the decision but there sure was to my eyes. There is no RTS in this series or hotspot.",145/6,300631,30.6,lbw b Head 14 (31m 27b 2x4 0x6) SR: 51.85,Kusal Perera
"that's the straighter one and Shanaka is bowled! The batsman made a tiny bit of room, playing for the turn as the ball pitched on off, he stayed back to cut it but missed as the ball zipped through to hit off",165/7,437316,34.5, b Zampa 13 (38m 17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 76.47,Dasun Shanaka
"the angle does it again, off stump knocked over! That one zipped through the defence as Dilruwan looked to defend it in front of off, the ball nipped in sharply from outside off and beat the outside edge to hit the stump",184/8,49920,37.4, b Starc 5 (15m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 71.42,Dilruwan Perera
"that's a yorker at 147kmh and whams into the middle stump! The angle, the speed, the length...all come together to push Lakmal on the back foot, he tries to block the ball but it beats him completely to disturb the bottom of middle stump",184/9,49619,37.5, b Starc 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Suranga Lakmal
"can't clear mid-off and SL are bowled out for 195! Pitched up, he lofts the ball on the off side but doesn't get enough and Faulkner takes a couple of steps back to catch that easily",195/10,212756,40.2,c Faulkner b Boland 32 (49m 38b 4x4 0x6) SR: 84.21,Sachith Pathirana
