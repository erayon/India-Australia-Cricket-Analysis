"gone! Full, swinging in, and it's so hard to drag your front leg away from those. He's forced to play across it, misses it by a long way, and he doesn't bother reviewing. I'd like to see ball-tracking anyway - seemed like there was just a bit of a chance it may have swung down the leg side. Nope. Hitting the middle of leg stump, it says",10/1,39037,2.4,lbw b Starc 6 (12m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 75.00,Azhar Ali
Starc returns and bounces out Sharjeel. Wade sensibly moves to his right and tracks down the skier with the big gloves. Starc runs in hard and hits the deck harder. Rapid chest-high short delivery just outside off. Sharjeel is late onto the hook and skies a catch to Wade,140/2,227762,24.4,c &dagger;Wade b Starc 79 (105m 69b 9x4 2x6) SR: 114.49,Sharjeel Khan
"good length and slanting away outside off, 147.4ks, Hafeez drives away from the body and sends an outside edge flying to the left of Smith. Starc comes back and what does he do? Takes two wickets in space of six balls and jolts the chase",145/3,41434,26.3,c Smith b Starc 3 (8m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Mohammad Hafeez
"appeal for caught behind? Did that loop off the arm or glove behind to Smith running back and across to his right at wide slip. Skiddy short ball, leaps off the surface, angled in, Malik was probably not sure whether to duck or fend. In the end, he does a bit of both, and also takes his eyes off the ball. The ball pings his forearm and loops over to slip. Malik clutches his wrist in pain. Australia did well not to review it. The physio is out to attend to Malik",181/3,42657,30.5,retired hurt 10 (24m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 76.92,Shoaib Malik
"there's that swing again, from the stumps this time, and Hazlewood's taken the big wicket. Looks to play a pick-up shot over mid-on, and that late swing meant he only got the leading edge to it, and the ball ballooned up for a simple catch to mid-on. An excellent delivery to end an excellent innings",220/4,348144,36.4,c Head b Hazlewood 100 (153m 109b 7x4 1x6) SR: 91.74,Babar Azam
"short outside off, and that's timed too well for Rizwan's liking. Goes for the slash, ends up slicing under the ball, and does it carry to Starc diving forward from third man? He himself isn't sure. They're checking upstairs now... Soft signal is out. Looks like he's taken it cleanly. Yup, out, and is that it for Pakistan?",246/5,323389,39.6,c Starc b Cummins 6 (16m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Mohammad Rizwan
"looks for the wide yorker, Akmal goes deep in his crease and across with his back foot to try and slap it through point, only manages a top-edge to the keeper",276/6,317273,43.3,c &dagger;Wade b Cummins 46 (59m 40b 7x4 0x6) SR: 115.00,Umar Akmal
"back of a length slower ball on off stump. Amir makes room to slog, ends up hitting the high part of his bat and looping high in the air. Maxwell, the fielder at cover, runs in from the 30-yard circle and completes a simple catch",282/7,290948,44.4,c Maxwell b Faulkner 17 (21m 14b 1x4 1x6) SR: 121.42,Mohammad Amir
"down the track comes Hasan, and Pakistan are eight down. Slowed it down, the tailender was through his slog well before it arrived, and then it spun away and offered Wade a simple stumping",312/8,681305,48.6,st &dagger;Wade b Zampa 13 (14m 10b 0x4 1x6) SR: 130.00,Hasan Ali
"and that is that. Yorker on middle stump, Wahab makes room to try and drive that through the covers, and he misses. The bails light up, to signal a 57-run win for Australia. Shoaib Malik, who retired hurt after being hit on the forearm, won't come out to resume his innings",312/9,43590,49.1, b Starc 17 (21m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 85.00,Wahab Riaz
