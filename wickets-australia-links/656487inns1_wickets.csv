"say what you will of Watson's batting, he is one of the best slip fielders in the world today. This catch is one for the ages. Slip catches are never easy, but the ones that swerve away from you at the last moment? That too to balls bowled at 150.1ks? Sarfraz just follows this quick length ball with his hands, edges it, looks like he has offered an easy catch to Watto until the ball swings away from him at the last moment. Watson has kept his eyes on it throughout, which is why he has dived along with it, facing third man by the time he finishes the catch, diving to the right, taking it with two hands. Almost  ehind his body is the catch completed",20/1,227760,4.4,c Watson b Starc 10 (19m 16b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.50,Sarfraz Ahmed
Pakistan openers are back in the sheds already. Plays a loose shot to a wide length ball. Away from the body with no foot movement. The only thing that moves is the ball. Slightly away from him. Takes a thick edge to the second slip where Clarke takes it easily,24/2,259410,5.1,c Clarke b Hazlewood 5 (23m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 38.46,Ahmed Shehzad
"oh will you believe it? Maxwell has brought up the breakthrough. Once again no singles for Misbah have meant Pakistan have to take the risks to keep the runs coming. He has previously hit Maxwell out of the attack with two sixes over midwicket, he tries a third one with a slog-sweep. Not quite to the pitch of the ball this time. Fatal. Top edge sits nicely with Finch at deep midwicket. Strange to see a rare hole-out by Misbah. That too at the short square boundary at Adelaide Oval. The big difference here is he has dragged this from well outside off",97/3,41378,23.2,c Finch b Maxwell 34 (75m 59b 1x4 2x6) SR: 57.62,Misbah-ul-Haq
"the bouncer has done the trick. Johnson has produced the loose drive with leaden feet. Look at his back foot move away as he drives. Johnson pushes this one up, angling it across Sohail, who drives away from the body, his back foot moving away from the line of the ball. The edge is taken",112/4,318788,26.4,c &dagger;Haddin b Johnson 41 (94m 57b 4x4 0x6) SR: 71.92,Haris Sohail
"what have you done Umar Akmal? This is a long hop at the Adelaide Oval with short square boundaries. Akmal has enough time to pause, do a quick opinion poll on where to hit this in the stands, and then take a selfie before hitting it. Unfortunately for him, he has found out the one man stationed there. Aaron Finch hasn't had to move an inch. Akmal is disgusted with himself. Smashes the bat into his pad",124/5,317273,29.1,c Finch b Maxwell 20 (24m 25b 2x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Umar Akmal
"he has found out deep midwicket. Finch has taken three deep midwicket catches today. Oh that short square boundary, what a temptress. Afridi looks to pull, but the ball is not short enough. He doesn't get all of it, Finch is prowling there, and takes this head high. Is this the last time Lala has paced off the field with gloves and pads on?",158/6,42639,33.6,c Finch b Hazlewood 23 (21m 15b 3x4 1x6) SR: 153.33,Shahid Afridi
"good shot but he had found the fielder. Full ball, on off, he knows there is no deep cover, he is looking to drive over the ring, just gets too close to the pitch of the ball, and finds Johnson at cover",188/7,43266,41.3,c Johnson b Hazlewood 29 (63m 44b 1x4 0x6) SR: 65.90,Sohaib Maqsood
Starc is the sole leading wicket-taker this World Cup. Finally he has drawn an edge. Riaz has finally hit that little white thing after backing away from the stumps. The outside edge settles nicely with Haddin,188/8,43590,42.2,c &dagger;Haddin b Starc 16 (35m 22b 2x4 0x6) SR: 72.72,Wahab Riaz
"Hazlewood ends with four in the quarter-final. Sohail backs away and swings. Gets a massive top edge that goes a million miles and comes down towards gully. Haddin the man with mitts on clears the area, settles under it, keeps his eyes on the swirling ball, and takes a safe catch",195/9,317252,43.6,c &dagger;Haddin b Hazlewood 4 (7m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Sohail Khan
"this time it has gone to hand. Faulkner gets a wicket, Starc takes a lovely catch. Clears the front let to pull, gets a top edge towards top edge, Starc rushes in and takes this low and diving forward",213/10,547092,49.5,c Starc b Faulkner 15 (32m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 68.18,Ehsan Adil
