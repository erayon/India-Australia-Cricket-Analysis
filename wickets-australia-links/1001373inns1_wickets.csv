"so the dropped chance didn't cost them much. Finch looks to play a predetermined sweep. Was across a long way even before the ball was delivered, so he was in no position to sweep that full delivery. He swung through way too early as well as the ball sneaked through to crash into the leg stump. Timely wicket for New Zealand. Australia were starting to run away with this.",68/1,5334,12.2, b Santner 19 (53m 34b 2x4 0x6) SR: 55.88,Aaron Finch
"the party's over. Good, low catch from Williamson at cover. This was full, Warner backed away and drilled it inside-out. Williamson stayed low and moved forward swiftly to take it inches from the ground. Applause, salutes for Warner. Super catch to end a super knock. Warner waited briefly for the no-ball check but eventually walks off.",213/2,219889,36.1,c Williamson b de Grandhomme 119 (149m 115b 14x4 1x6) SR: 103.47,David Warner
"as easy as they come for Santner. This was a length ball outside off, Smith went across to play an agricultural heave but only managed to get the outside part of the bat to slice it to deep point. Not even the possibility of another century deterred him from playing his shots. End of a fine knock from the skipper!",248/3,267192,39.1,c Santner b Southee 72 (112m 76b 6x4 1x6) SR: 94.73,Steven Smith
"caught at backward point. Full and wide outside off, Head throws his hands at the ball. Slices a catch to Munro at backward point, who clasps it in front of his face",319/4,530011,45.6,c Munro b Southee 57 (56m 32b 6x4 2x6) SR: 178.12,Travis Head
"bowled'em.  No celebration at all from NZ. Good length on middle, Wade eyes a cross-bat slog across the line. He does not touch it. Boult hits the stumps. Rare dot",357/5,230193,48.5, b Boult 11 (13m 5b 1x4 1x6) SR: 220.00,Matthew Wade
