"that's a bingo, strikes first ball! Tosses up the legbreak from over the wicket, Rossouw attempts a reverse sweep and is hit on the front pad, the ball spinning back in - looked pretty adjacent to off stump. Job's a good'un for the moustachoied young spinner",145/1,318845,17.1,lbw b Zampa 63 (75m 45b 10x4 1x6) SR: 140.00,Rilee Rossouw
"bowled him, Faf plays on! Boland doesn't bother to celebrate, decent ball that maybe nibbled back in a touch, slightly loose poke from the captain and the zing bails light up",268/2,44828,31.4, b Boland 26 (54m 36b 1x4 0x6) SR: 72.22,Faf du Plessis
"hooks the bumper, excellent take at deep square leg! So Duminy crashes the party and then ends up falling the pool... Another wicket for Boland, courtesy a low grab diving in from the boundary by Head",280/3,44932,33.2,c Head b Boland 9 (8m 8b 2x4 0x6) SR: 112.50,Jean-Paul Duminy
"dug in again, de Kock hooks hard - but this time it's his undoing! Head takes another superbly judged catch running along the rope and de Kock has to walk off 11 short of a national record... Centurion stands for the centurion, he gets some handshakes on his way off. A quite brilliant innings that has made a difficult chase look simple",280/4,379143,33.4,c Head b Boland 178 (142m 113b 16x4 11x6) SR: 157.52,Quinton de Kock
