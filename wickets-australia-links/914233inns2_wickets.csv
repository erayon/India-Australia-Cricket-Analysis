"fifty and out! Chipped back to the bowler off a leading edge. Drifting into the pads again, Khawaja targets the leg side with a gentle little flick. He can only spoon a return catch to Santner who breaks the rousing opening partnership",122/1,215155,16.2,c &amp; b Santner 50 (59m 49b 7x4 0x6) SR: 102.04,Usman Khawaja
"this wasn't crunched. This was just edged. Cracker of a stop followed by a cracker of a  catch. Full and outside off, Smith feels for the ball and outside-edges it towards first slip. But Ronchi dives full-stretch to his right and snaps up the one-handed catch. Ronchi may have lost it with the bat, but he still has it with the gloves",133/2,267192,19.3,c &dagger;Ronchi b Henry 2 (12m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66,Steven Smith
"<b>double-blow from Henry</b>! He lets out a massive roar. Bailey is gone for a golden duck. He went unsold in the IPL auction as well. This is a gem. Back of a length, snakes back in a long way off the seam. Rips through the gate and hits the top of off",133/3,4451,19.4, b Henry 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,George Bailey
"Boult has Maxi chopping on. Boult flashes a smile. Fractionally short, not much room either, Maxi shapes to pull. He gets a thick inside edge that rebounds off pad and hits the furniture",144/4,325026,22.3, b Boult 6 (13m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Glenn Maxwell
"big appeal for lbw, not given by ump Billy. Did the pitch outside leg? Baz, Ronchi, and Santner have a chat. Santner coaxes his captain to <b>review</b> it. Arrowed in from round the wicket, strikes the back pad. No inside edge involved. Pitched in line, the tracker shows that it would smash the middle of middle stump. No century for Warner. Game-changing incision from Santner?",191/5,219889,30.2,lbw b Santner 98 (120m 79b 8x4 4x6) SR: 124.05,David Warner
"<s>It soars over for a six</s> Milne pulls off a stunning one-handed catch at the edge of the midwicket boundary (allow me to pick up my jaw from the floor). <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnJZJAr1cNw"" target=""_blank"">Milne does a Vettori</a>.Wade can't believe this. He drops to his knees. Pushed through short on middle, Wade skips back and nails a pull. It looks destined to go for a six. But Milne takes flight, times his jump to perfection, and comes out with the ball in his left hand. It took some time for the crowd and Milne himself to realise that he had plucked it!",197/6,230193,32.3,c Milne b Santner 2 (11m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22,Matthew Wade
