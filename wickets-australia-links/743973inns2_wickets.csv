"one good ball is all you need though. Starc gets one absolutely right. Very full on middle and leg, one of Starc's trademark yorkers. Sneaks past Porterfield's bat, takes a bit of his pad and takes the stumps more importantly. Unplayable delivery, came back in late to WP who had no chance against a delivery as good as that",5/1,24611,0.5, b Starc 4 (3m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,William Porterfield
"gone this time. Flashes outside off again but pays the ultimate price. Swing from a good length outside off, Stirling looks to drive on the up with no feet movement but the out swing to the right-hander helps in taking the outside edge and a good catch by Wade",7/2,303427,1.4,c &dagger;Wade b Coulter-Nile 0 (8m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Paul Stirling
"gone this time. Joyce plays another ugly hoick but it was a really good innings. Joyce comes down the track to smash the length delivery over long-off, doesn't get to the pitch though and the ball sneaks through to knock back off stump",93/3,24249,14.2, b Maxwell 44 (59m 33b 2x4 1x6) SR: 133.33,Ed Joyce
and NOb goes! Not a great shot with the long-on fielder in place and against the turn. Flight on off and NOB can't help himself from dancing down the track and skewing the shot straight down long-on's throat.,106/4,24289,16.3,c Burns b Maxwell 45 (62m 53b 5x4 0x6) SR: 84.90,Niall O'Brien
"excellent catch now. Short ball on middle again, Balbirnie looks to pull and gets a thick leading edge which flies down to fine leg. NCN on the boundary settles under the swirler and takes a really good, pressure catch.",115/5,303423,17.5,c Coulter-Nile b Cummins 12 (14m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Andy Balbirnie
"what a ball that was. Wilson cannot do anything about that. Very short, and very quick aimed right at the batsman' throat. Wilson looks to evade the bouncer but the ball kisses the glove and lobs up, Wade completes the catch.",137/6,24609,19.4,c &dagger;Wade b Cummins 1 (14m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Gary Wilson
"needless wicket that. Mooney gently taps the length ball into the off side and sets off for a run, Thompson sends him back way too late and Bailey at cover runs in and takes the bails off with Mooney having given up. Wow, this game has turned",137/6,24237,19.6,run out (Bailey) 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,John Mooney
"and Starc gets the wicket now with a good delivery. Changes the length this time, pitches on a good length and Thompson heaves at the ball but can only get a thick outside edge. Easily taken by Wade",155/8,414821,22.4,c &dagger;Wade b Starc 24 (23m 16b 0x4 2x6) SR: 150.00,Stuart Thompson
"short ball on leg, McBrine connects with his pull extremely well but the ball goes high in the air straight down Cummins' throat at deep square leg. Good effort that from the batsman. Just didn't get enough of it",157/9,417381,23.1,c Cummins b Coulter-Nile 7 (14m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 77.77,Andy McBrine
full and straight and that will be the game to Australia. Young misses the hoick and the leg stump is taken off. Great delivery. But the task was a bit too hard for the tail-enders.,157/10,364343,23.4, b Coulter-Nile 0 (2m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Craig Young
