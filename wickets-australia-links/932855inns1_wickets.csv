"gone. Finch persists with the sweep. Flat on off, the quicker delivery. Finch clears a front foot and tries to smash his sweep through square leg but was quite far from the ball. The ball missed his cross-batted swat and clattered into off stump. Tahir sets off in typical fashion. Finch struggled for any fluency in that knock.",48/1,5334,9.6, b Imran Tahir 13 (55m 28b 2x4 0x6) SR: 46.42,Aaron Finch
"gone! What a start this is for SA after the drinks break. A short delivery on middle is pulled powerfully but straight to midwicket. Comfortable height too. Warner was waiting on that back foot and hit it beautifully, just some indecisiveness whether to go over or keep it down. In the end, did neither. But what an innings that was",184/2,219889,34.1,c Amla b Parnell 109 (157m 120b 11x4 2x6) SR: 90.83,David Warner
"taken this time! Amla takes it, and Khawaja has to go. Flat on off, Khawaja gets low to sweep and gets another top edge which goes up in the air and is taken at short fine leg. Beautiful bowling, not afraid to give the ball some air even to the left-hander. Australia losing their way",196/3,215155,39.1,c Amla b Phangiso 59 (118m 71b 4x4 1x6) SR: 83.09,Usman Khawaja
"given! Bailey is gone. Wrong un' from Tahir on middle, strikes Bailey in front. Bailey reviews. That looks pretty adjacent. It has spun a little into Bailey and he did have a significant stride. his only hope is height I guess. No bat. Umpire's call, just clipping leg stump so Bailey has to go.",217/4,4451,42.1,lbw b Imran Tahir 11 (12m 9b 0x4 1x6) SR: 122.22,George Bailey
"Marsh's struggling innings ends. Another full toss on off, below the waist. Marsh mis-times his heave to midwicket. Did not get any of it there, straight to Behardien at deep midwicket",240/5,272450,45.4,c Behardien b Abbott 10 (16m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Mitchell Marsh
"full and straight, given! Yorker on off, Wade sets up for another scoop and misses it. The ball strikes Wade well outside off though, Umpire Joel Wilson gives him out. Shocking decision, struck him well outside the line",274/6,230193,48.6,lbw b Rabada 24 (19m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 171.42,Matthew Wade
