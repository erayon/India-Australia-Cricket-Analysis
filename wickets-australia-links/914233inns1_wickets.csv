"bowled him! What a lift for Boland! McCullum charged him again but this time the length was not full and McCullum's swing connected with nothing, Boland hit the top of off stump. The fans at the Cake Tin rise to give McCullum a cheer as he walks off",35/1,37737,4.2, b Boland 28 (18m 12b 2x4 3x6) SR: 233.33,Brendon McCullum
"caught at deep cover! Guptill came out of his crease and moved towards leg to smash a good length ball from outside off down the ground, the bat turned in his hand as he made contact and he ended up slicing the ball towards the cover boundary, where Khawaja settled under the catch. He judged that well, because the ball seemed to be swirling and it wasn't straightforward",88/2,226492,15.4,c Khawaja b Marsh 31 (64m 45b 4x4 0x6) SR: 68.88,Martin Guptill
"that's a loose ball and a loose shot and a loose dismissal, Marsh is thrilled with his second wicket. He bowled a short and wide ball outside off from around the wicket, with a cross seam so it gripped the pitch a bit. It might have been called wide had Nichollls let it go but he chased it with a half-hearted waft at edged through to Wade. If you're going to slash, slash hard ...",95/3,539511,17.3,c &dagger;Wade b Marsh 4 (9m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Henry Nicholls
"KW can't hit the repeat button,<strong> Zampa celebrates his maiden ODI wicket</strong>. Nicely lobbed up outside off, KW drives in the air again, this time he picks out Smith at extra-cover. Big, big wicket. KW spins his head away in disappointment",158/4,277906,29.2,c Smith b Zampa 60 (100m 74b 5x4 1x6) SR: 81.08,Kane Williamson
"Elliott does a KW. Zampa gives this loads of air, tempts Elliott into an airy stroke. The ball dips, and the batsman drives it in the air.... into the lap of Maxi who takes it calmly despite a little juggle. <b>Two in two for the debutant</b>",164/5,44956,31.2,c Maxwell b Zampa 32 (53m 47b 2x4 1x6) SR: 68.08,Grant Elliott
"another soft dismissal, another failure for Ronchi. Back of a length, Ronchi may have misjudged the pace on this. The back-of-a-length ball stopped on him as he shaped to flick. He can only chip it to Mitch Marsh at mid-on; chest-high catch",193/6,7502,36.3,c Marsh b Boland 19 (20m 19b 0x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Luke Ronchi
he comes back and takes down Anderson. Full and swerves away with the angle outside off. Anderson does not want to hold back. He throws his bat at it. He can only settle with a thin tickle behind to Wade. NZ are falling away,205/7,277662,40.2,c &dagger;Wade b Hazlewood 16 (46m 28b 0x4 1x6) SR: 57.14,Corey Anderson
"well, that was simple! Fierecly struck but straight down the throat of the Australian captain. End of a sparky cameo from Milne. He dances out to a length ball and drills it to Smith at cover",266/8,450860,47.4,c Smith b Hazlewood 36 (32m 27b 2x4 1x6) SR: 133.33,Adam Milne
"knocked him over. The middle stump is flattened. Back of a length, straight on middle, Henry clears his front leg. Goes for a wild, dirty slog, and misses. Hazlewood pounds the middle stump",266/9,506612,47.6, b Hazlewood 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Matt Henry
