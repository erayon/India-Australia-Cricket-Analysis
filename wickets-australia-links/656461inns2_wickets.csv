"bowls a fantastic back of a length outside of off which cramps Lahiru for space, with the extra bounce catching the outside edge of his bat to fly over to the keeper behind, who snaps it up gleefully. Australia pick up one early as Sri Lanka look to mow down this huge chase",5/1,301236,1.4,c &dagger;Haddin b Johnson 1 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00,Lahiru Thirimanne
"Faulkner raps Dilshan right on middle and off as he plays all around this one. Goes up straightaway for the appeal, which the umpire corroborates soon after. Dilshan wants the <b>review</b> though after consulting with Sangakkara at the other end. It was another back-of-the-hand slower ball which definitely hit in line as there are four reds across the screen. Dilshan has to go, much to the delight of the Sydney crowd. Has been an excellent firestarter of a knock to get Sri Lanka's chase off on the best possible foot",135/2,48472,21.3,lbw b Faulkner 62 (91m 60b 8x4 0x6) SR: 103.33,Tillakaratne Dilshan
"Mahela takes on the arm of Clarke at mid-off after driving this fuller one from Starc, and has to pay the price as he nails down the stumps at the non-striker's as he looked to usher in Sangakkara to the strike. Was well out of his ground, despite putting in the dive, as he heads back to the pavilion. That could be a major blow to SL's chances as this chase gets into the business end of the innings",188/3,49289,30.6,run out (Clarke) 19 (39m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 86.36,Mahela Jayawardene
"and that may very well be game for Sri Lanka as Kumar finally departs from the middle after looking to go after this Faulkner delivery, which was slipped in at a fuller length, as he ends up slicing over to the man at deep cover, who this time is able to get under it comfortably. There was some hesitation on the part of the fourth umpire to give this as replays show Faulkner just about, and I mean just about, got his foot behind the line. Really was touch and go there, but because a conclusive decision could not be reached, Sangakkara has to go. Has been a fine effort in this stirring chase so far",201/4,50710,33.5,c Finch b Faulkner 104 (140m 107b 11x4 0x6) SR: 97.19,Kumar Sangakkara
leg-side delivery which is helped down to deep fine leg,281/4,300628,41.1,retired hurt 52 (38m 24b 8x4 1x6) SR: 216.66,Dinesh Chandimal
"and now Mathews has to go after going at this shortish length from Watson, with the ball kissing the face as he went in for the attempted hook. Looks like he was surprised by the length as Haddin is able to take this comfortably from behind",283/5,49764,41.3,c &dagger;Haddin b Watson 35 (57m 31b 2x4 1x6) SR: 112.90,Angelo Mathews
"lets loose of the handle as he tried to swat Johnson over midwicket, with this one swirling high over mid-on, with Doherty getting under it safely to complete the catch. Took the pace of this shorter one as Perera threw everything but the kitchen sink at it",293/6,233514,42.2,c Doherty b Johnson 8 (8m 3b 2x4 0x6) SR: 266.66,Thisara Perera
"sends one crashing into the stumps of Prasanna, who just played all around this full yorker on middle which just tailed away a touch. Too good for the tail-ender as he walks off to the pavilion",305/7,268740,44.3, b Starc 9 (11m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 81.81,Seekkuge Prasanna
"Faulkner strikes right away for his captain as Tharanga, Sri Lanka's last recognised batsman, has to go after carting this back of a length straight to the man stationed at cow corner, who is able to get under it quite comfortably",307/8,50747,45.2,c Warner b Faulkner 4 (20m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Upul Tharanga
"fantastic yorker on middle which is spooned straight up to mid-off to end the game. There is a bit of confusion as to whether Chandimal would re-emerge, but it looks like the game is officially over",312/9,273439,46.2,c Doherty b Starc 7 (8m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 87.50,Sachithra Senanayake
