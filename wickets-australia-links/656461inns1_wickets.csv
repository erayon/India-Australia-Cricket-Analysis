"what a set-up from Malinga! this time takes off the pace of this length delivery on middle and off, deceiving Warner as he offers a half-hearted push which finds it way to extra-cover, who is able to take it comfortably. Huge blow for Australia as Warner has to go",19/1,219889,4.2,c Prasanna b Malinga 9 (16m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 75.00,David Warner
Prasanna you beauty! Removes the ever-dangerous Finch with a slider down the leg side which Finch attacked early as he played down the wrong line. Sangakkara does the rest as he picks this up and flicks the bails in one fluid motion as Finch looks back disconcertingly. Huge roar from the Sri Lankans as Finch makes his way back to the pavilion,41/2,5334,8.4,st &dagger;Sangakkara b Prasanna 24 (38m 24b 3x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Aaron Finch
"Malinga shows why he is the best in the business when it comes to these moments as he displaces the base of middle and leg with a fierce leg-stump half-volley that hits the mark. Clarke, looking for quick runs through long on, plays all around it. Hang on, though, as Malinga may have just overstepped here. Clarke may just get called back here as he lands the back of the foot just on the line. In the end, Clarke continues off as the skipper has to go for a run-a-ball 68",175/3,4578,31.5, b Malinga 68 (82m 68b 6x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Michael Clarke
"and now it is Steven Smith's time to go as he looks for a tonk straight down the ground, with this one swirling high in the air before Thisara, somewhere between long off and extra-cover, is able to get under it and take it before falling away. Met with great excitement by the SL fans as Smith storms away after a brilliantly played 72",177/4,267192,32.3,c Perera b Dilshan 72 (107m 88b 7x4 1x6) SR: 81.81,Steven Smith
"and the curtains are drawn on yet another Maxwell blinder as he fails to get away this full-toss delivey from Perera, with this going straight up over mid-on, with Malinga doing well to complete the catch, with a tumble to finish. Maxwell hasn't yet departed as they are looking at the front foot no ball. No issues there as he was miles behind the crease. Looks like this was also a legitimate delivery as it didn't arrive to him over waist height. Has to depart after what has been one of the super innings of the tournament so far",337/5,325026,46.1,c Malinga b Perera 102 (73m 53b 10x4 4x6) SR: 192.45,Glenn Maxwell
"in the slot again as Faulkner is obligated to get to the other end after he hears Watson's call. Drilled this to the fielder at cover, who is able to pick it up and throw it to Perera at the non-striker's, who is able to flick off the bails before Faulkner grounded his bat. Bonus wicket for Sri Lanka as Faulkner goes for a golden duck",338/6,270484,46.3,run out (Mathews/Perera) 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,James Faulkner
"Watson now looking for the long blast over long off, but Chandimal who is able to settle under this top-edge, is able to complete a catch finally in the deep. Ends a fantastic knock from Watson who has done his World Cup campaign a whole lot of good with this effort",368/7,8180,48.6,c Chandimal b Perera 67 (86m 41b 7x4 2x6) SR: 163.41,Shane Watson
"slower length delivery now which Haddin looks to send orbiting over Sydney, but ends up slicing away over to cover, who is able to get under it safely. Has to go as Australia look to rack up as many as possible off these final deliveries",373/8,5560,49.3,c Perera b Mathews 25 (16m 9b 4x4 1x6) SR: 277.77,Brad Haddin
"hammers away this length delivery through long on, with Johnson wanting two from the get-go. The fielder in the deep pounces on this before sending in flat throw to Mathews, who is able to knock over the stumps before Starc had grounded his bat. The second run was never really on there, but you got to do what you got to do",374/9,311592,49.4,run out (Perera/Mathews) 0 (1m 0b 0x4 0x6) SR: -,Mitchell Starc
