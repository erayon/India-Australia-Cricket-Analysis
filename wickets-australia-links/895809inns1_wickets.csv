"and he has to go now. What a shame, that was quite a poor delivery. Short and wide outside off from Paris, Dhawan looks to caress a cut but the extra bounce of the wicket takes the outside edge of the bat to Wade. Paris' first ODI wicket.",9/1,28235,2.2,c &dagger;Wade b Paris 6 (10m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 150.00,Shikhar Dhawan
"what has happened there? Some hesitation and Kohli may be gone here. And he is gone. Kohli has to walk off after a fantastic innings. Against the run of play, Australia have a breakthrough. He stayed back to pummel a pull to fine leg. Richardson got around and rocketed a throw back to Wade, on the full, and Wade whipped off the bails. Kohli was found a foot short of his crease despite a dive.",134/2,253802,23.5,run out (Richardson/&dagger;Wade) 59 (84m 67b 4x4 0x6) SR: 88.05,Virat Kohli
"Rohit is gone. What a sad way to go, but that is the luck of the draw. He isn't very happy. Rahane drives a slower delivery back at Faulkner who gets a bit of his hand on it, to deflect the ball onto the leg stump. End of a splendid innings from Rohit.",255/3,34102,42.2,run out (Faulkner) 124 (175m 127b 11x4 3x6) SR: 97.63,Rohit Sharma
"gone. Dhoni's iffy innings ends. Slower ball, but in the slot. Dhoni belts it with a lot of power but straight down the throat of long-on. Maxwell settles under it and takes a sitter. India stuttering again",276/4,28081,45.6,c Maxwell b Boland 11 (16m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 110.00,MS Dhoni
"gone. Steven Smith takes the catch as Rahane falls. Back of the hand legcutter on off, Rahane comes down and swipes it in the air but the ball hangs in the air for a long time. He did not get enough distance and Smith settles under it at deep midwicket to swallow the catch",298/5,277916,48.3,c Smith b Faulkner 89 (107m 80b 6x4 1x6) SR: 111.25,Ajinkya Rahane
"another one goes. Pandey this time. Length delivery on middle, Pandey wanted to go through midwicket but the legcutter stopped in the wicket a touch to take the top edge of Pandey, the ball carries to long-off who takes another easy one",302/6,290630,48.5,c Paris b Faulkner 6 (13m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 120.00,Manish Pandey
"gone. Ashwin goes now. Full delivery on off, Ashwin walks across to ramp to fine leg but the ball deviates away only to take the top edge, the ball spoons up for short third man to take.",306/7,26421,49.3,c Boland b Hastings 1 (4m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Ravichandran Ashwin
"excellent last over from Hastings. Just four runs off it. Yorker on off, Jadeja digs it out back to the bowler. Hastings collects and takes off the bails.",308/8,234675,49.6,run out (Hastings) 5 (9m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Ravindra Jadeja
