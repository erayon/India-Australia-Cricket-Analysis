"McCullum's final innings is over! And he gets a massive cheer from the Seddon Park crowd, they are rising to their feet to clap off their captain. That went high in the air and Hastings caught it superbly. McCullum had charged and slogged but ended up slicing the ball high in the air over the bowler's head. It was surely Maxwell's catch? He only had to move a little to his right from mid-off. But Hastings had moved quickly to the ball from mid-on and at the last moment he took a look at Maxwell, who was not going for the catch, so Hastings stuck out his large hands and the ball dropped in",84/1,37737,9.3,c Hastings b Marsh 47 (39m 27b 6x4 3x6) SR: 174.07,Brendon McCullum
"bowled him! Williamson has been tied down by the line Australia have been bowling to him, they have been outside off stump on a good length most of the time, cutting off his leg side. Now Williamson gets a slightly wide one but the length is good outside off, he reaches to cut the ball without moving his feet - he usually moves back and across so smoothly - and bottom edges on to his stumps. That ball actually seamed into the right-hander to hit the bottom edge",123/2,277906,18.2, b Boland 18 (38m 28b 1x4 0x6) SR: 64.28,Kane Williamson
"Zampa has troubled Guptill today and now he's got him! He drifted the legbreak to pitch outside leg stump and Guptill was always in trouble trying to sweep that without clearing his front foot, he had to reach for that and was in an awkward position - cramped for room - to play it, he ended up top edging tamely to short fine leg, where Hastings took an easy catch",131/3,226492,19.5,c Hastings b Zampa 59 (84m 61b 4x4 3x6) SR: 96.72,Martin Guptill
"make that four! Nicholls steps forward and plays a loose drive away from his body at a good length ball outside off, Smith is waiting at first slip. A really loose shot and another soft dismissal. New Zealand in danger of being derailed again after a strong start",171/4,539511,28.4,c Smith b Hazlewood 18 (36m 29b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.06,Henry Nicholls
"Anderson has picked out Khawaja at long on! He stepped out to clear the straight boundary and was cramped for room a little by the line angling into him from around the wicket. He timed the shot well because it travelled really quickly to Khawaja, but he did not hit it high enough. Khawaja moved to his left to catch it",223/5,277662,40.3,c Khawaja b Hazlewood 27 (53m 45b 0x4 1x6) SR: 60.00,Corey Anderson
"Ronchi's struggles continue, he's mis-timed this one straight to long-on, where Boland takes an easy catch. The length was good and the line angling into middle stump, Ronchi swung across the line and mis-timed it completely",237/6,7502,43.1,c Boland b Marsh 5 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 62.50,Luke Ronchi
"two in two for Marsh, what a series he is having! Maxwell runs in from the deep square leg boundary and dives to take the catch. The ball was dipping sharply as he caught it. Elliott had got down on one knee outside off to play a slog-sweep of sorts, he timed it well but hit it in the air and not high or far enough",237/7,44956,43.2,c Maxwell b Marsh 50 (100m 62b 1x4 1x6) SR: 80.64,Grant Elliott
"an appeal for lbw and he has been given this time! Milne has a word with Bracewell and is walking off. That was missing leg stump surely? The full ball swung sharply into the right-hander and hit the boot before ricocheting on to the bat. He should have reviewed that, it was sliding past leg stump.",246/8,450860,44.3,lbw b Boland 5 (7m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125.00,Adam Milne
bowled him! Bracewell is bowled between bat and pad as he moves forward to drive at a good length slower ball that swings into him a fair bit. Hastings hits middle and leg stump. Australia have got the ball hooping in the last few overs. New Zealand in danger of being bowled out with so many overs to go,246/9,362541,45.2, b Hastings 2 (13m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Doug Bracewell
"and it's all over! Hastings ends the innings with 27 balls to go! He bowls a swinging yorker at the No. 11 Sodhi, who jams his bat down on it. He manages to get some bat on it but not enough to prevent the ball from squeaking through and rolling on to his stumps",246/10,559066,45.3, b Hastings 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Ish Sodhi
