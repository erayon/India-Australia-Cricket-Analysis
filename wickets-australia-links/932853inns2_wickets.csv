"got im. Big wicket. Parnell gets the big fish. He isn't bothering with the review. Huge breakthrough. Fullish on middle and leg, the ball jags back and hits Warner flush in front of leg. Umpire's call was the likely outcome, if Warner reviewed.",1/1,219889,1.4,lbw b Parnell 1 (7m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00,David Warner
"bowled im. Another big wicket. Khawaja is beaten and SA have struck. Overpitched on off and middle, hustles Khawaja for pace who gets his angled bat down too late. The ball clips the pads and then clatters into the stumps",10/2,215155,4.3, b Rabada 2 (12m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57,Usman Khawaja
"another wicket. Huge one again. But Smith reviews. Fullish on off, Smith shuffled across and missed a flick. The ball strikes him right in front of middle and leg. Looks out. No bat either. Australia in big trouble now. All reds and Smith is gone.",21/3,267192,7.5,lbw b Parnell 8 (16m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Steven Smith
"given this time. This one did not look out. But Umpire Joel Wilson gives him. Flat legbreak is sliding down leg, but Shamsi and co. don't care. He has a wicket in his first over on his debut. Maxwell's struggles continue",47/4,325026,11.5,lbw b Shamsi 3 (20m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85,Glenn Maxwell
"outside edge and gone. Marsh is gone. A thick outside edge is gratefully accepted by de Kock. A flat legbreak outside off, Marsh tries to cut but gets a nick through. Big wicket. Aus five down now",72/5,272450,16.3,c &dagger;de Kock b Imran Tahir 8 (17m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 61.53,Mitchell Marsh
"Umpire Wilson's finger goes up. Rabada has Wade nicking behind! Australia six down and sinking.

"<strong>141ks</strong>, inswinging yorker, too hot for NCN. It would have been too hot for any batsman. The leg bail is tipped off. Blockhole ball, NCN is beaten for pace. He can't bring his bat down in time",85/7,261354,21.6, b Rabada 0 (11m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Nathan Coulter-Nile
"ump Illingworth gives it. Googly, rips in from outside off, hits the front pad in front of off. Was that doing too much? Replays showed that the ball pinged the pad first before Zampa got an inside snick",90/8,379504,22.5,lbw b Imran Tahir 0 (4m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Adam Zampa
Finch clears his front leg and holes out! AB pumps his fist and is mobbed by his team-mates. Finch stepped away outside leg in a bid to open up the off side. He is cramped for room by another quicker ball. 90.3ks. He ends up slicing a drive. AB dives full-stretch to his right at extra cover and pouches it,113/9,5334,30.3,c de Villiers b Phangiso 72 (134m 103b 6x4 3x6) SR: 69.90,Aaron Finch
