"Timbahhhhhhh. Starc you beauty. What a ripper [in Bill Lawry voice]. What an occasion. What a start. He blows it full, he swings it in, he lands it between the stumps and the popping crease. McCullum is tentative for once. The bat comes down late. Off stump is set back. Starc goes away on a celebratory run. MCG is on its feet. The game is not over obviously, but Starc... how is that for a start?",1/1,37737,0.5, b Starc 0 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Brendon McCullum
"what a bowling change. And how much has that miss on that half tracker played on Guptill's mind. Stays back to a ball slightly short than good length. He goes back to play for the offbreak and punch it. The ball turns, but not as much as he is expecting it to. Hits the top of off. Big Show on Big Stage. Also Haddin gets in Guptill's face with his applauding gloves to leave a sour note on what has been Australia's afternoon",33/2,226492,11.2, b Maxwell 15 (48m 34b 1x4 1x6) SR: 44.11,Martin Guptill
"Johnson has looked like getting a wicket nearly every ball, and he has done so now. He has bowled excellently. His pace and aggression so far means any slight misbehaviour off the pitch is going to have a big impact. This is a length ball, around that middle and off channel. Previously balls have cut and fizzed away, this stops a touch. Only a touch, mind you. Williamson is early in defending, and lobs this back to Johnson. He is looking to work this to leg, but this has also angled away towards off, which means he has checked his shot a little",39/3,277906,12.2,c &amp; b Johnson 12 (52m 33b 1x4 0x6) SR: 36.36,Kane Williamson
"<b>slower ball first up</b>, and they have appealed for a catch at the wicket. Dharmasena has gone to the third umpire with no soft signal this time. This is a slower legcutter, nearly a yorker, really really full. Taylor looks to drive, and the ball lobs to Haddin's right. The umpires check on both counts: bump ball and a clean catch. Replays show the ball has pitched just before hitting Taylor's bat, takes the outside edge, and the edge is soft, dying to Haddin's right. He flies to his right, takes a stunning one-handed catch. This is a huge wicket. Clutch players strike first ball in the Powerplay",150/4,38699,35.1,c &dagger;Haddin b Faulkner 40 (104m 72b 2x4 0x6) SR: 55.55,Ross Taylor
"James Faulkner. He is a big player. That's why Australia were desperate to get him fit. He is a clutch player. Both with bat and ball. He has been asked to come back in the Powerplay, and he has taken out two wickets in three balls. Slower ball to get Taylor out, followed by a normal pace length ball, and then a quick yorker. Anderson is slow on this. Beaten for pace. He has squeezed it past the bat. Rushes away towards point after hitting the off stump. On replay, this is not quite a yorker, but a really full ball that kisses the pad and hits off stump. He has done him in for pace. Slower ball was 112ks, this was 133ks",150/5,277662,35.3, b Faulkner 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Corey Anderson
"he won't be getting it for too long as he is gone now. Lovely captaincy and lovely catch by Clarke. He has first of all placed himself at slip, and then taken a catch that looks easy on TV but isn't. Ronchi has flashed at a wide length ball, the edge has flown towards slip, Haddin makes a move towards the catch before leaving it alone for Clarke. So Clarke has done really well to not take his eye off it, and catches it superbly head high",151/6,7502,36.2,c Clarke b Starc 0 (6m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Luke Ronchi
"this is top-quality bowling from Australia. Johnson has come back to completely outdo Vettori. Full inswinging yorker at a high pace. Off the round arm it comes, dipping on him, tailing back in, Vettori is late on it, is beaten on the inside edge, is hit on the pad, and the deflection rattles the stumps",167/7,38710,40.6, b Johnson 9 (23m 21b 1x4 0x6) SR: 42.85,Daniel Vettori
"Faulkner has brought that one final big wicket. Slower ball does it again. It is so hard to pick because it comes out with the seam up. Elliot sees a length ball that he can hit over the leg side, but he is way too early into the shot. He gets the outside edge, and Faulkner's back-of-the-hand slower ball always bounces extra, which means it carries to Haddin for yet another catch. Australia all over New Zealand. A bit of a send-off again, but he gets a generous applause from the full house. raises his bat to them",171/8,44956,41.5,c &dagger;Haddin b Faulkner 83 (133m 82b 7x4 1x6) SR: 101.21,Grant Elliott
"oh that is not the intention but they have got the wicket all the same. This is a yorker gone wrong. A low juicy full toss outside off with all the off-side fielders in the ring. Henry drives, but neither gets power behind it nor manages to keep it down. Easy catch for Starc at cover-point",182/9,506612,44.5,c Starc b Johnson 0 (14m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Matt Henry
"this could be sensational. It is actually sensation regardless of the result actually. Short of a length, at the hip, defended to short leg, and Maxwell spots from the corner of his eye that Southee is a little lazy getting back into the crease at the non-striker's end. He lets rip a throw at the non-striker's end. Southee has barely a foot to go back, but Maxwell's throw has beaten him. Southee's bat has got stuck in the ground. Sensational run-out. Sums up Australia in the field today",183/10,232364,44.6,run out (Maxwell) 11 (21m 11b 0x4 1x6) SR: 100.00,Tim Southee
