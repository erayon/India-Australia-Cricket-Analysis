"bowled him! That was a poor shot from Finch, slogging across the line to a full, straight ball, and I think he may have yorked himself",76/1,5334,11.4, b Ali 32 (49m 32b 3x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Aaron Finch
"got him! Marsh has a propensity to slice the ball uppishly behind square, and Finn entices exactly that shot from him with a full, wide tempter, and he hits it straight to backward point",92/2,6683,16.1,c Bell b Finn 45 (67m 48b 6x4 0x6) SR: 93.75,Shaun Marsh
"stunning delivery, and he started celebrating even before the umpire gave it out. It was the inswinging yorker, and White's front pad was thrust across the crease, offering a large target, and there was no way he was going to bring his bat down and play around his pad.",92/3,8291,16.3,lbw b Finn 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Cameron White
"and he's struck again! Brain-fade from Maxwell, who sees a bit of air and goes for the big slog-sweep. Hits it well, but picks out Root at deep midwicket. He didn't have to move an inch.",161/4,325026,26.4,c Root b Ali 37 (39m 38b 4x4 0x6) SR: 97.36,Glenn Maxwell
"taken! Bell's grabbed a beauty. Faulkner was halfway forward to drive and it moved away late and caused the bat to turn in his hand and the ball to slice uppishly towards point. It was a low catch, inches off the ground, and Bell made it look much simpler than it was",216/5,270484,37.2,c Bell b Woakes 35 (44m 43b 4x4 0x6) SR: 81.39,James Faulkner
"and he's gone. That's a short ball, a back-of-the-hand slower ball, and he made himself a lot of room and had to reach out a long way to try and connect. Ended up top-edging it, and the ball looped into point's hands",297/6,5560,47.3,c Bell b Woakes 42 (50m 29b 4x4 1x6) SR: 144.82,Brad Haddin
"gone! That was right up there from Woakes again, and he drove firmly to mid-off and set off for the single. Nervy moment there, and Taylor's throw hit the stumps direct at the bowler's end. He was moving towards extra cover and only had one stump to aim at",302/7,5961,49.3,run out (Taylor) 4 (7m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 36.36,Moises Henriques
