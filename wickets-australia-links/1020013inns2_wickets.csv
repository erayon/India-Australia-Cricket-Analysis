"Neesham dives to his right from square leg, reaches for the ball with both hands, and plucks it out. Boult and Neesham combine to send back Australia's stand-in captain. Not a happy comeback for Finch. Hip-high short ball outside off, Finch simply flaps a pull to square leg",9/1,5334,3.1,c Neesham b Boult 4 (12m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14,Aaron Finch
"holes out to deep third man running in. Eden Park raises itself to a roar. Back of a length and very wide outside off, Head flails at it. The ball swirls into the hands of Munro off a top edge",10/2,530011,3.5,c Munro b Boult 5 (16m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Travis Head
"there's a clicking sound as the stand-in keeper Latham gloves the ball. Umpire Knight shakes his head. NZ challenge the on-field not-out decision. Cross-seamer from Southee. Handsomb simply prods at it away from the body, and nicks it behind. Hotspot detects a white blotch and nicko detects a spike as the ball passes the bat. Handscomb has to go. Umpire Knight reverses his call, raises his finger, and sends back Handscomb",18/3,334337,6.1,c &dagger;Latham b Southee 7 (11m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Peter Handscomb
"Santner beats Marsh in the air. Marsh uses his feet, Santner drags his length back, the ball dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch. The batsman misses a straight ball - okay spins in slightly - and Latham the stand-in keeper does the rest. Poor shot from Marsh. Looked very ungainly",48/4,6683,11.2,st &dagger;Latham b Santner 16 (37m 21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 76.19,Shaun Marsh
"Nicked off. Australia are five down and sinking at Eden Park. 142.3ks, back of a length and outside off, Maxwell was aiming to run it down to third man. He only feathers it behind to Latham. He's having a good day behind the stumps, unlike Handscomb",54/5,325026,12.6,c &dagger;Latham b Ferguson 20 (27m 24b 3x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Glenn Maxwell
"all pace. Or rather the perception of it for Ferguson's throttled down has paralysed Heazlett's feet. In an effort to compensate, he throws his hands at a back of a length delivery and it takes the edge through to stand-in keeper Tom Latham",67/6,826679,18.2,c &dagger;Latham b Ferguson 4 (27m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 36.36,Sam Heazlett
"topples him and Eden roars with Munro! It's the cross-seamer coming down on a good length, stump-to-stump. Faulkner swings across the line and he groans the moment he misses the ball. He knows where it is heading. Doesn't look back",148/7,270484,34.3, b Munro 25 (69m 49b 1x4 0x6) SR: 51.02,James Faulkner
"Santner beats Cummins in the air, beats him with turn and snaffles him. He does not have many variations, isn't fancy, but is pretty smart. Cummins jumps down the track. The bowler lobs it up wide outside off and finds some turn as well. Latham helps himself to another stumping.",196/8,489889,40.6,st &dagger;Latham b Santner 36 (30m 28b 5x4 1x6) SR: 128.57,Pat Cummins
"tossed up outside off, angling away from around the wicket. Starc goes low, attempts a slog-sweep and holes out to deep midwicket. Strikes with the last ball of his spell and eases NZ's nerves",226/9,311592,42.6,c Neesham b Santner 3 (11m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Mitchell Starc
"<b>Venue: Eden Park. Hero: Kane Williamson. Result: New Zealand win a thriller</b>! You've heard that before? Whoa.... What a game. Breathless stuff. First let us give credit to Williamson for placing himself at short mid-on. Southee nails a yorker on off stump, Stoinis can only dig the ball out fairly straight to Williamson. He collects the ball, falls in front of the stumps, and under-arms it into the stumps to catch Hazlewood short. Hazlewood had lost his head. He was off for a single - there wasn't a single there - he has to spin back. He dishes out a desperate dive, but that's not enough. <b>This is the first time Hazlewood has been dismissed in an ODI</b>. Spare a thought for Marcus Stonis, though. Nearly pulled off an incredible heist from nowhere",280/10,288284,46.6,run out (Williamson) 0 (26m 0b 0x4 0x6) SR: -,Josh Hazlewood
