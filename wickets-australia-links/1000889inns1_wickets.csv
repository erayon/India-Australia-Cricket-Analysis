and he finally gets his man. This is good bowling from Junaid. Gets it to shape away just a tad from the back of a length region after tempting the batsman to go after it by offering enough width. Warner chases it with an angled bat and skews it off the outside edge to the wicketkeeper,31/1,219889,5.5,c &dagger;Mohammad Rizwan b Junaid Khan 16 (27m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 72.72,David Warner
"Usman Khawaja has edged to first slip but he stands his ground and the umpires go upstairs to check if it's a clean catch. That's a fantastic catch from Sharjeel. It was a good length ball, just outside off and Khawaja was shaping up to slap it through backward point. But there was not enough room to free his arms and he gets a thick outside edge. Sharjeel gets down to his left and snaffles a superb catch. And it is clean. No doubts there and Khawaja has to go back. What a start to Junaid's comeback game!",40/2,215155,7.6,c Sharjeel Khan b Junaid Khan 17 (39m 21b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.95,Usman Khawaja
"and now Amir has one. Marsh has picked cover with a loose drive first ball. Amir has done superbly to fire a tempter outside off, forcing the batsman to lean across and reach out. Marsh is no good position, arches up as he plays the drive, meaning there was no way he was going to keep that down. Sends it straight into the hands of Imad Wasim at short cover",41/3,272450,8.5,c Imad Wasim b Mohammad Amir 0 (4m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mitchell Marsh
"and the bowler has the last laugh. Hasan Ali celebrates with a jump and a pump of the fists. Follows up the short ball with a fuller delivery outside off, forcing Head to go after it and try to drive through covers. The batsman falls for the trap and gets a healthy edge for his troubles. Rizwan catches it without fuss behind the stumps",86/4,530011,17.2,c &dagger;Mohammad Rizwan b Hasan Ali 29 (36m 31b 5x4 0x6) SR: 93.54,Travis Head
knocked him over. Quicker ball from Wsim and Maxwell charges down the track and the bat hits the pad as he tris to force it through the off-side. Does not make contact with the ball as a result and it goes through to take out the stumps,128/5,325026,26.2, b Imad Wasim 23 (34m 26b 2x4 1x6) SR: 88.46,Glenn Maxwell
good length ball that is delivered at a slower pace and Smith is through with the shot early. Gets an inside edge as he comes forward looking to force it through the off side and the ball crashes into the stumps. Done in by the lack of pace,193/6,267192,42.3, b Imad Wasim 60 (155m 101b 2x4 0x6) SR: 59.40,Steven Smith
"goes through the gate. Wade's troubled stay against spin comes to an end. Played all around it. Attacking line and on the stumps. Wade pushes forward awkwardly, leaves a big gap between bat and pad and the ball sneaks through that gap to take out middle stump",199/7,230193,43.4, b Shoaib Malik 35 (72m 56b 3x4 0x6) SR: 62.50,Matthew Wade
slower full ball and some good fielding by Junaid. He is having a dream comeback game. It was full and Starc was trying to clip it away but inside-edges it to the pad and the ball just rolls away. He looks for a non-existent single and it does not help that Faulkner is a tad unresponsive. Sent back late and Junaid picks it up and nails a direct hit,207/8,311592,45.4,run out (Junaid Khan) 3 (9m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60.00,Mitchell Starc
"short ball, tries to hook and gets a top-edge as the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. Probably got a glove again and it's a very feeble edge. This time, Cummins walks. Does not bother looking at the umpire as he walks away even as the wicketkeeper starts appealing",212/9,489889,46.5,c &dagger;Mohammad Rizwan b Mohammad Amir 0 (6m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Pat Cummins
held at point and that's the end of the innings with four balls remaining. It was a short of good length ball but he is in no position to slap it. Skews it in the air to point where Shafiq settles under it easily,220/10,270484,48.2,c Asad Shafiq b Mohammad Amir 19 (32m 21b 2x4 0x6) SR: 90.47,James Faulkner
