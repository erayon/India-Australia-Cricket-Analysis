"Another failure for Finch, he picks out Nicholls to perfection at shortish square leg. Good length and Boult finds inswing again. Finch looks to thump it down the ground from outside off with no feet, he can only drag an inside edge, which carries to Nicholls. That looked ungainly from Finch",6/1,5334,1.5,c Nicholls b Boult 3 (8m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 37.50,Aaron Finch
"Boult strikes again. After bowling six deliveries on off or outside off, Boult brings this one back into the hips with the angle from around the stumps. Teases Smith to flick, despite the presence of two catching midwickets and a shortish square leg. The Australia captain shuffles across off, but can't keep it down. He holes out to Nicholls too at shortish square leg, falling into the leg-side trap. He goes for a seven-ball duck",11/2,267192,3.6,c Nicholls b Boult 0 (10m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Steven Smith
"soft ball, soft dismissal. Spooned to midwicket. Early Christmas present for Santner and de Grandhomme. Good length holds its line on off, the batsman perhaps plays a bit early and lobs a simple catch. Santner did not even have to budge",73/3,4451,18.3,c Santner b de Grandhomme 23 (61m 51b 1x4 0x6) SR: 45.09,George Bailey
"De Grandhomme strikes twice in three balls. Marsh could consider himself unlucky. Just short of a good length and on off stump. Marsh is cramped for room as he aims to punch through the covers. But he is stapled to the crease He manages a thick inside-edge, which hits the front leg and then ricochets onto the top of the stumps",73/4,272450,18.5, b de Grandhomme 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mitchell Marsh
"pre-meditated. Good delivery from Santner. Head moves across perhaps looking for an expansive shot through the off side. But Santner gets it to drift away from around the stumps and Head is far away from the line of the ball as a result. It does not turn much either, so he can't get anywhere close to it and the ball crashes into the stumps",178/5,530011,39.1, b Santner 37 (82m 70b 2x4 0x6) SR: 52.85,Travis Head
"Wade pre-meditates a slog-sweep. Santner is smart with his variations in pace. He held this back, 78ks. Wade gets it high on the bat and holes out to deep midwicket",226/6,230193,45.2,c de Grandhomme b Santner 14 (27m 23b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60.86,Matthew Wade
"full and just outside off, Faulkner plonks his front leg forward and swings early, slower delivery from Boult.  The batsman skies a catch to long-on",262/7,270484,49.3,c Guptill b Boult 13 (21m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,James Faulkner
"Boult splatters the stumps at the non-striker's end and catches Warner short from the last delivery of the innings. Pinpoint yorker just outside leg, Warner, having backed away outside leg, jams it towards short extra cover. Boult runs in, then to his right, and throws the stumps down. Excellent work",264/8,219889,49.6,run out (Boult) 156 (214m 128b 13x4 4x6) SR: 121.87,David Warner
