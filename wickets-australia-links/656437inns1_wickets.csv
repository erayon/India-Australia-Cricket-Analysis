"Southee draws first blood, the crowd erupts! He took the risk of pitching it up again just outside off, swung it in a bit and the ball went through the drive Finch unleashed. Off stump knocked over, Southee pumps his fists and is mobbed by his team-mates",30/1,5334,2.2, b Southee 14 (10m 7b 1x4 1x6) SR: 200.00,Aaron Finch
"Watson has holed out! It was a innocuous short ball on the stumps, Watson went back in the crease and pulled it to the leg side where Southee went to his right to complete an easy catch at deep midwicket",80/2,8180,12.6,c Southee b Vettori 23 (44m 30b 2x4 0x6) SR: 76.66,Shane Watson
"two in two for NZ, Southee gets Warner lbw but he wants a <b>review</b>! This one swung into the batsman to cram him up as the ball probably headed towards middle leg, Warner went on is toes to defend as the ball hit just above the knee roll after pitching on leg. It's hitting the stumps, with umpire's call so Warner has to go!",80/3,219889,13.1,lbw b Southee 34 (58m 42b 2x4 1x6) SR: 80.95,David Warner
"caught behind, one more for Vettori! It was a bit flatter outside off, Smith pushed at it towards the off side and the ball went straight into Ronchi's gloves after a thick outside edge",95/4,267192,16.3,c &dagger;Ronchi b Vettori 4 (17m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 36.36,Steven Smith
"he's chopped it on, Australia crumbling here! The ball was angling away from Maxwell from outside the off stump, he looked to force it through the off side without any footwork and get an edge to disturb his stumps",96/5,325026,17.2, b Boult 1 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Glenn Maxwell
"one more, what's going on?! Marsh also drags it on and goes for a duck! This back of length delivery was seaming away from the batsman, he went to the back foot to defend on the off side but played the wrong line and got an edge onto his stumps. The crowd is roaring!",97/6,272450,17.4, b Boult 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mitchell Marsh
"oh my, Clarke has given it away, Boult gets his third! He gave Clarke room on the off side, Clarke swung his arms uppishly and gave a straightforward catch to Williamson at short cover",104/7,4578,19.6,c Williamson b Boult 12 (37m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Michael Clarke
"that's a wonderful catch, one more falls! Johnson made room for the full delivery just outside off, drove it in the air and Williamson was there again, this time to dive to his right to grab it with both hands",106/8,6033,21.3,c Williamson b Boult 1 (6m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28,Mitchell Johnson
"missing - the middle stump's gone missing! What a beaut there from Boult - it pitched right on middle stump on length, looked like it was angling in, which Starc played for, but it held its line after pitching and knocked over only the middle stump. The crowd is loving it",106/9,311592,21.6, b Boult 0 (2m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mitchell Starc
"goes this time, gives a catch to short third man! Anderson pitched it shorter this time, Haddin went through the shot little early with a drive and got a thick edge for short third man. The last man falls",151/10,5560,32.2,c sub (TWM Latham) b Anderson 43 (70m 41b 4x4 2x6) SR: 104.87,Brad Haddin
