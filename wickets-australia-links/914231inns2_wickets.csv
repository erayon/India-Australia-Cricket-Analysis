"137km, edged and caught at second slip! Henry pitched on a good length around middle and off and got the ball to move just a little across the left-hander, Marsh prodded from his crease and was squared up as he did so, the outside edge flew quickly to Guptill who took a relatively simple catch to his right",10/1,6683,1.5,c Guptill b Henry 5 (7m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.50,Shaun Marsh
"bowled him, off the inside edge, Henry has struck again! Smith drives off the front foot and away from his body at a good length ball that pitches well outside off, it barely moves in so he had to reach for it, the ball cannons into the stump off the inside edge of the bat. Henry has been New Zealand's best limited-overs bowler this summer",33/2,267192,5.2, b Henry 18 (14m 17b 3x4 0x6) SR: 105.88,Steven Smith
"no fireworks! Warner has been given lbw, but will he review? He has a talk with George Bailey and he decides to go! That's too high, surely? Warner was in his crease as he tried to hit across the line and was struck flush on the front pad by a length ball angling into him, rushing him for time. His front foot was off the ground too. I'd love to see replays of that, I reckon it was too high. Both feet were off the ground and it hit him on top of the pad. Yes, replays show it would have missed the stumps.",39/3,219889,6.4,lbw b Boult 12 (28m 11b 2x4 0x6) SR: 109.09,David Warner
"Bailey gives Anderson a chance to make amends and this time he's been caught! That man Henry again, bowling fuller and on a middle stump line, Bailey flicks in the air off the front foot and hits it straight to midwicket, a much easier chance this time.",40/4,4451,7.6,c Anderson b Henry 2 (11m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00,George Bailey
"and Maxwell has gone! Williamson grabs a stunner at extra cover! He lofted the ball towards extra cover with no timing, Williamson moved to his left from mid-off, the ball was almost lobbing over his head when he jumped up with left-hand outstretched above his head and caught it as it began to drop behind him. He was airborne as he caught it",40/5,325026,8.1,c Williamson b Boult 0 (7m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Glenn Maxwell
"and Australia lose a sixth inside ten overs! Incredible stuff. Boult hits a great length around leg and middle and takes the ball away from the right-hander, Marsh is squared up in his crease as he prods away from his body and he nicks through to McCullum at second slip",41/6,272450,8.6,c McCullum b Boult 0 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mitchell Marsh
"#Edenparksotiny, but Wade has holed out in the deep! Anderson pitched short of a length and angled it across the left-hander, Wade got on the front foot and heaved across the line, hitting it more high than far, Nicholls settled under the catch on the cow corner boundary",120/7,230193,20.1,c Nicholls b Anderson 37 (58m 38b 3x4 2x6) SR: 97.36,Matthew Wade
"and he's bowled Faulkner! That was a rash shot, Faulkner stepped out of his crease and swiped across the line at a length ball with a cross bat, Milne hit the top of off stump. Only two more to take for New Zealand. That ball cut into the right-hander just enough to beat the bat",121/8,270484,21.1, b Milne 36 (60m 33b 6x4 0x6) SR: 109.09,James Faulkner
"and he strikes first ball! Richardson backs away towards leg and slogs at a slow one outside off, he lofts it tamely in the air off the bottom of the bat and Williamson runs from mid-off to extra cover to take the catch",148/9,272262,24.1,c Williamson b Santner 19 (13m 13b 1x4 2x6) SR: 146.15,Kane Richardson
"two in two for Santner and it's all done and dusted at Eden Park! Hastings slogs at a slow one and mis-hits it towards long-on, Guptill runs in and slides to take a well-judged catch. Josh Hazlewood is stranded at the other end and is yet to open his account in ODI cricket after playing 15 matches",148/10,228622,24.2,c Guptill b Santner 8 (21m 9b 2x4 0x6) SR: 88.88,John Hastings
