"gone! This time it was just back of a length and close enough to off stump for the leaden-footed Coetzer to edge rather than miss as he aimed a massive back-foot punch, looking to go through the covers. Flies to Smith at shoulder height, and he takes it easily",8/1,25446,2.5,c Smith b Starc 0 (11m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Kyle Coetzer
"ouch. That was short, with a little bit of width on it, and MacLeod has played the cut fairly well, but this one he pops into the air, and straight into the hands of backward point",36/2,232435,6.6,c Warner b Starc 22 (31m 19b 5x4 0x6) SR: 115.78,Calum MacLeod
"excellent bouncer from Watson, and Mommsen goes second ball. Has to drag the pull from over his right shoulder, and he could only top-edge it to Starc stationed at backward square leg",37/3,461281,7.3,c Starc b Watson 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Preston Mommsen
"Johnson gets into the party now. Back of a length, fourth-stump, angling away. No footwork in that attempted back-foot punch, and Clarke dives to his right from second slip to grab the edge, lovely low catch",50/4,364329,10.1,c Clarke b Johnson 0 (12m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Freddie Coleman
"and he strikes first ball, with a fairly rubbish ball. It's floated up outside off, it's a half-volley, and Berrington slices his drive in the air, straight to Warner at cover",51/5,25490,11.1,c Warner b Maxwell 1 (5m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66,Richie Berrington
"and Cummins is among the wickets now. It's shortish, on the hips. Machan shuffles across to try and tuck it into the leg side. It gets big on him and he ends up popping it in the air, offering a simple catch to Faulkner at long leg",78/6,297488,16.2,c Faulkner b Cummins 40 (63m 35b 6x4 0x6) SR: 114.28,Matt Machan
"another. It's short on a fifth-stump line, and Cross' weight was on the front foot. He was in no position to play that, it got big on him, and kissed the shoulder of his bat through to the keeper",79/7,417268,16.4,c &dagger;Haddin b Cummins 9 (24m 20b 2x4 0x6) SR: 45.00,Matthew Cross
"gone, eight down. That's a length ball, angling into the corridor. No footwork from Taylor, not the first Scotland batsman to suffer from that issue, and he pokes hesitantly and nicks it through to the keeper",95/8,353431,20.1,c &dagger;Haddin b Cummins 0 (13m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Rob Taylor
"clatter. Off-stump yorker, and Davey is late bringing his bat down. It actually straightened a touch and went past the outside edge",130/9,407265,25.2, b Starc 26 (36m 35b 4x4 0x6) SR: 74.28,Josh Davey
"boom, and that off stump takes another beating. It's full and fast and Wardlaw gave himself room to play through the off side, bat was nowhere near it in the end. Again it straightened off the pitch",130/10,509107,25.4, b Starc 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Iain Wardlaw
