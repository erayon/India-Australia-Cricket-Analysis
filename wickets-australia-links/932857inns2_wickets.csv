"gone this time. The slower delivery and Australia have their first. A slow, good-length delivery outside off, the ball stops on Fletcher who checks his stroke. Since he withdraws very late, the ball bobs up off the withdrawing bat and is easily taken by point. Will that spark something?",74/1,51862,9.5,c Bailey b Faulkner 27 (39m 27b 3x4 2x6) SR: 100.00,Andre Fletcher
"flat and gone! Skids on with the arm and goes through Charles. Poor shot. Zampa lands it perfectly, a flat, slider which skids off the pitch and strikes Charles in front. Charles played back and missed a straight ball, absolutely plumb",85/2,333066,13.4,lbw b Zampa 48 (57m 38b 5x4 1x6) SR: 126.31,Johnson Charles
"ump Brathwaite's finger goes up and Bravo walks off. Zampa returns and strikes. Tosses a legbreak, grips in the surface and bounces. Bravo pushes with hard hands and <strong>gloves it.</strong> Wade forward and to his right to snaffle the tickle",167/3,277472,30.5,c &dagger;Wade b Zampa 39 (86m 63b 3x4 1x6) SR: 61.90,Darren Bravo
"and he's gone. What is happening? Zampa bowls this flat and quick down leg, Samuels goes back and allows the ball to hit his pad and he goes through for a leg bye. Wade runs across to short square leg, picks up, turns around and throws the stumps down while moving, at the bowler's end. Wow, what an effort from Wadey.",240/4,52983,40.4,run out (&dagger;Wade) 92 (116m 87b 8x4 4x6) SR: 105.74,Marlon Samuels
"that is probably where NCN should have been from the start. Bowls the offcutter slightly wider outside off, and Ramdin wants to guide to third man but doesn't account for prodigious movement back into him. Goes right in the gap between bat and pad and clatters into off stump",254/5,52917,43.2, b Coulter-Nile 29 (59m 38b 1x4 1x6) SR: 76.31,Denesh Ramdin
"gone. <strong>Holder is given. But he opts for the review</strong>. Good length delivery outside off, which jags back in again. Holder attempts a big swing and the ball goes through between bat and pad. Looks like he has missed it, but there is a sound. Not sure what it is. Swerves back in and Wade collects well, diving to his left. Not enough evidence to overturn this apparently, and Holder cannot believe it. Hangs on his bat before trudging off ever so slowly. Would have stayed not out had he been given not out. On replays, looks like there is a big deviation as the ball passes the bat, so good decision",254/6,391485,43.4,c &dagger;Wade b Coulter-Nile 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Jason Holder
