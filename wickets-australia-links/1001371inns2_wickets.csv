"gone! Another early wicket for Australia. Latham chops on. Good length outside off, fifth-stump channel. Latham looks to prod one into the off side but the ball moves back late. Takes the inside edge and clatters into the stumps. Another opening batsman undone by just a hint of lateral movement. Well bowled Hazlewood",3/1,388802,1.6, b Hazlewood 2 (8m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Tom Latham
"gone. Huge wicket. Williamson nicks off. Full outside off, the ball holds its shape. Williamson goes after it, looking to drive through the off side. Gets a thick outside edge which carries at head height to Smith at first slip who takes a sharp reverse-cupped catch. NZ lose their best batsman.",34/2,277906,7.5,c Smith b Hazlewood 9 (29m 16b 2x4 0x6) SR: 56.25,Kane Williamson
"Neesham holes out to Hazlewood at wide long-on. Good length and outside off,  Neesham has a clean swing at the ball. But can't clear the long boundary. Hazlewood runs to his left and pouches it. Starc returns and breaks the 92-run stand",126/3,355269,21.5,c Hazlewood b Starc 34 (62m 36b 5x4 0x6) SR: 94.44,James Neesham
"<strong> whoa, Smith has pulled off a stunning catch</strong>. He flies to his left like a goalkeeper and completes an incredible one-handed catch. Lands face-first, but tucks the ball up against his ribs, and hangs on. Smith's team-mates jump onto him. This was a poor ball, though - short and wide outside off - Watling cuts hard, but can't keep it down. It seemed destined to fly off to the boundary until Smith took flight and intervened at backward point. Smith plucks it out with his wrong hand. He barely had any time to react. He is having a banner day at the SCG.  Even Smith is surprised by that catch",140/4,38924,24.3,c Smith b Marsh 6 (11m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 46.15,BJ Watling
"Guptill has hit a dirty long hop to midwicket. Maxwell leaps, and takes the overhead catch on the second attempt. Guptill drops to his knees in despair. Dragged short and outside off, skids on Guptill pulls it flat and hard. Finds the substitute fielder",185/5,226492,32.6,c sub (GJ Maxwell) b Zampa 114 (150m 102b 10x4 6x6) SR: 111.76,Martin Guptill
"holes out to Warner at long-on. Dolly catch.  <b>With two wickets in five balls</b>, Zampa has tilted it Australia's way. Tossed-up legbreak on off, dips late in its flight. Santner lofts it half-heartedly, the bat turns in his hands, and picks out Warner to perfection, who blows a kiss and celebrates the catch",187/6,502714,34.4,c Warner b Zampa 0 (8m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mitchell Santner
"very full, and cuts in, de Grandhomme is stapled to the crease as he plays across the line. The ball skids on to rap his front pad plumb in front of middle.  No signs of an inside edge. Umpire Dharmasena's finger goes up. The batsman reviews more out of hope rather than conviction. He has no hope at all. Horrid review. Three reds flash, and New Zealand are seven down",203/7,55395,37.4,lbw b Hazlewood 6 (13m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 75.00,Colin de Grandhomme
"full and outside off, right in the hitting slot. Henry clears his front leg and swipes the slower one in the air. He plays early. He gets more height as opposed to distance. Bailey runs in from deep midwicket and tracks down the skier. First wicket for Cummins on return",253/8,506612,43.2,c Bailey b Cummins 27 (28m 15b 4x4 1x6) SR: 180.00,Matt Henry
"Bailey tracks down another skier. This is tougher. He moves about 30 metres to his left from extra cover and pouches it near the mid-off region. Slower full ball outside off, Munro slogs and holes out for 49",255/9,232359,43.5,c Bailey b Cummins 49 (91m 59b 4x4 1x6) SR: 83.05,Colin Munro
"Chopped on. <b>Australia go 1-0 up</b>. The middle stump is pegged back. Back of a length and slanted in, Ferguson aims to force it through the off side. Ends up playing it on. He bags a three-ball duck on international debut",256/10,493773,44.2, b Marsh 0 (6m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Lockie Ferguson
