"got him! <b>Duck on debut</b>, Starc's got his customary wicket in the first over. Pitched on off stump at a good length, veered back in, hit high-ish on the pad, but that looked quite adjacent. Fernando was pinned to the crease, playing around his front pad, slow in doing so as well.",1/1,784369,0.4,lbw b Starc 0 (4m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Avishka Fernando
"big appeal for caught behind from the keeper, <b>Wade wants to review</b>, it but the bowler has no clue. Australia have gone for a check with the third umpire. There seems a noise, and a deviation as well when the ball passes the outside edge.  I'm not sure they use Snicko here as part of the DRS. But even without it, Mendis has been given, fair call from Aleem Dar. It was a good length ball in the off stump corridor. Had Mendis pushing at it. Held its line just enough to get the nick",18/2,629074,5.2,c &dagger;Wade b Hastings 1 (23m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 12.50,Kusal Mendis
"won't be saving Sri Lanka this time. It's a length ball outside off, Chandimal wants to paste it through extra cover. Wasn't supposed to play it off the front foot with the length being reasonably short. The bounce does him, takes the edge and goes through to the keeper",31/3,300628,8.5,c &dagger;Wade b Boland 5 (16m 14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 35.71,Dinesh Chandimal
"there is the wicket. Always looked on the cards the way he was playing. Short length outside off, de Silva chooses the wrong shot. Tries to drag a pull from outside off, the ball gets big on him and he ends up spooning a catch to midwicket. Was never going to be in control of that stroke. Quality innings, but a lot more could have achieved after that start. Hastings is pumped, Australia hitting back",121/4,465793,28.6,c Finch b Hastings 76 (135m 87b 9x4 0x6) SR: 87.35,Dhananjaya de Silva
"another poor stroke and Zampa gets his first. SL unravelling. Pitches on leg, spins towards off. Short enough for Angelo to play the pull, but he went right back and looked to hit that too hard. Gets a top edge which is easily taken by Wade running around towards square leg. Planning - check. Execution - a big red cross.",130/5,300629,32.3,c &dagger;Wade b Zampa 7 (25m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 43.75,Angelo Perera
"one more. Kusal has to go. Terrible stroke. Sri Lanka are not helping themselves. Flight on off, Kusal comes to the pitch and bunts a catch straight to cover. Did not look to go over cover, did not bother with keeping that down. Ended up chipping his wicket away",134/6,300631,33.4,c Warner b Head 6 (20m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85,Kusal Perera
"oh no, he has lobbed a catch to Finch at cover. Another poor stroke, neither here nor there. Short, slow ball outside off. Perera backs away and tries to hit that through point, but the slowness of the surface means he ends up slapping a catch to cover.",165/7,233514,42.2,c Finch b Hastings 13 (43m 26b 2x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Thisara Perera
gets him. Hastings bangs one in with a cross-seam delivery banged in on a short length. Dilruwan was through the stroke too early and gets a thin outside edge to Wade. More signs of the slow surface as Dilruwan was through his pull early,199/8,49920,47.1,c &dagger;Wade b Hastings 18 (23m 21b 1x4 0x6) SR: 85.71,Dilruwan Perera
"gone. Pathirana holes out to long-off. Not a good shot again. Slower ball outside off, Pathirana goes back in his crease and chips a catch to long-off. <b>Hastings gets five</b>, his best ODI bowling figures",200/9,212756,47.6,c Faulkner b Hastings 24 (66m 39b 2x4 0x6) SR: 61.53,Sachith Pathirana
"taken at backward point. <b>Hastings gets six. </b>Mathews' brave effort ends. Could be a crucial 12 runs these. Short delivery on off, very high. Mathews shuffles across and goes after that but only ends up splicing a skied catch to Bailey.
