"inswinger to Finch, played on to his front pad, it loops back to the bowler... got him! There's the first, New Zealand are amongst them!

"back of a length and pulled again, another top edge - this time there's a man under it! McCullum sent a man back to deep square and Warner took on the challenge, his fire is doused and New Zealand have their second wicket. The ball was banged in, couldn't control the pull and Grant Elliott took a good, low catch running in",63/2,219889,12.2,c Elliott b Henry 45 (51m 46b 7x4 0x6) SR: 97.82,David Warner
"bowled him, Clarke has chopped on! He wont get to hit the winning runs but he will get a huge ovation from the MCG as he walks off for the last time in ODIs. He was trying to run one to third man, got an inside edge down on to the woodwork... Was that him wiping away something from his eye as he crossed the boundary rope?",175/3,4578,31.1, b Henry 74 (84m 72b 10x4 1x6) SR: 102.77,Michael Clarke
