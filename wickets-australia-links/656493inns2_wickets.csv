"here comes Shikhar... and there goes Shikhar! He's absolutely <i>skelped</i> this but sends the ball straight into the safe, safe hands of Glenn Maxwell at deep extra cover! Hazlewood roars, clenched fist pumping, they've got their opening. Pitched up outside off, maybe slightly off the toe as Dhawan drove over the infield, only one man out there but it flew to him like a homing pigeon",76/1,28235,12.5,c Maxwell b Hazlewood 45 (57m 41b 6x4 1x6) SR: 109.75,Shikhar Dhawan
"bouncer from Mitch, top-edged and gone - Kohli has cracked! Slow start, quick end for Virat, took on the Johnson short ball and emphatically lost. It was aimed across him, outside off, attempted to pull and sent a lusty blow straight up, Haddin had time to do a little square dance to his left, opened up the gauntlets and swallowed India's star man",78/2,253802,15.3,c &dagger;Haddin b Johnson 1 (11m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 7.69,Virat Kohli
"bowled him, Johnson strikes back! He leaps up to the skies in celebration, Australia's spearhead has taken out another key batsman, fast and furious, right through Rohit, off the inside edge and lighting up the wicket. Held cross seam, nipped back at pace and clipped the leg bail. Lights are going out for India",91/3,34102,17.6, b Johnson 34 (83m 48b 1x4 2x6) SR: 70.83,Rohit Sharma
"dangles the bat at a short ball, nicks it through to Haddin! India are four down and swaying in the evening breeze! Some redemption for Faulkner, who hit the pitch hard with another cross-seam delivery, got bigger than Raina was expecting, wanted to run it down but just succeeded in steering to the keeper. Soft, squidgy dismissal but Faulkner doesn't care, he's cock-a-hoop",108/4,33335,22.6,c &dagger;Haddin b Faulkner 7 (20m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 63.63,Suresh Raina
"Rahane plays with fire, fiddling at a length ball off the back foot... it slides past the outside edge. No one reacts but Australia then decide to <b>review</b>, not sure on whose prompting. Looks like a gamble, but... While there's no visible deviation, a thin scrape on Snicko is enough for Erasmus, he tells Dharmasena to overturn his decision. Australia have rolled the dice and come up trumps! Quite what Rahane thought he was doing, I don't know, hugely risky and he walks off without a backward glance",178/5,277916,36.2,c &dagger;Haddin b Starc 44 (87m 68b 2x4 0x6) SR: 64.70,Ajinkya Rahane
"called for one, direct hit from Smith and Jadeja is struggling... Gone! Dhoni tried to pinch one more to backward point, ran it too close to the fielder and the throw rifled in to catch Jadeja a couple of inches short",208/6,234675,41.5,run out (Smith) 16 (23m 17b 2x4 0x6) SR: 94.11,Ravindra Jadeja
"gone, Dhoni is run out by a direct hit from Maxwell, that's all, folks! Dhoni heads straight off, head bowed, nothing even India's supernatural finisher could do about this. He'd worked the singles hard, flicked this off his legs to midwicket and let probability have a go - Maxwell only had one stump to aim at but he dead-eyed it, Dhoni didn't even bother to dive, he was that far out",231/7,28081,44.3,run out (Maxwell) 65 (94m 65b 3x4 2x6) SR: 100.00,MS Dhoni
"bowled him, done for lack of pace and zing go the bails! Faulkner was carted around at the start of the innings but he's come back well, gets the legcutter on target and Ashwin plays all around it",232/8,26421,45.4, b Faulkner 5 (19m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 38.46,Ravichandran Ashwin
"another, Faulkner hits the stumps again! Two in two, India's time is almost up. Popped it on a length, slightly wobbly medium pace and Mohit played it like a stick of Kryptonite",232/9,537119,45.5, b Faulkner 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mohit Sharma
"full and straight and Umesh is castled, too good for a No. 11. <b>Australia win by 95 runs</b> and go through to the World Cup final, India, the defending champions, lose their title as well as an 11-match unbeaten run",233/10,376116,46.5, b Starc 0 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Umesh Yadav
