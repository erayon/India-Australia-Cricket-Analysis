"full and clipped off the pads... straight to short midwicket! Hales has been thrashing around but getting nowhere for a while and he's finally picked out a fielder, wasn't over the shot and the catch was snapped up at waist height. Hales swipes his bat in frustration before sloping off",52/1,249866,9.3,c Marsh b Cummins 9 (40m 31b 1x4 0x6) SR: 29.03,Alex Hales
"comes forward, chipped into the off side without conviction - and Roy is gone! This is a waste, he was looking so good and he has donated Agar his maiden ODI wicket, popping the ball straight to short extra cover. Maxwell initially palmed it up into the air and then grabbed it at the second attempt",86/2,298438,14.6,c Maxwell b Agar 63 (63m 45b 9x4 0x6) SR: 140.00,Jason Roy
"picks out long-off...Maxwell strikes first ball back! Aims to clear the boundary again, but it comes off the bottom of the bat and lands comfortably in the lap of Starc as he takes a couple of paces in",205/3,24598,33.1,c Starc b Maxwell 62 (73m 56b 7x4 1x6) SR: 110.71,Eoin Morgan
"slogged high into the leg side and Finch positions himself safely under it at mid-on! Stokes will obstruct the England innings no longer, he was trying to put Maxwell into the confectionary stall but only succeeded in sending a top edge billowing straight up into sky",231/4,311158,39.2,c Finch b Maxwell 14 (22m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 70.00,Ben Stokes
"full, driven along the carpet to Smith at mid-off, Bairstow takes on the throw... and a direct hit does for him! It was very tight and YJB went scampering back for a second from the ricochet but the umpires sent it upstairs and replays proved he was a few milimetres short",271/5,297433,45.3,run out (Smith) 17 (24m 18b 1x4 1x6) SR: 94.44,Jonny Bairstow
"Moeen goes big... and goes home! Tries to pull a length ball from outside off stump and sends a top edge steepling to midwicket. England are trying to tap out, here",273/6,8917,46.1,c Pattinson b Cummins 1 (5m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Moeen Ali
"short and pulled to midwicket, Plunkett had come charging down... and he's run out by a mile as Taylor sends him back! Another flaccid dismissal, although to be fair to Taylor there was no run there",279/7,19264,46.5,run out (Bailey/Cummins) 1 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Liam Plunkett
"short of a length, tries to club down the ground... but can't clear mid-off! Taylor falls for 101, top-edging tamely to the edge of the ring to leave England eight down",291/8,297635,49.2,c Agar b Starc 101 (165m 114b 5x4 0x6) SR: 88.59,James Taylor
