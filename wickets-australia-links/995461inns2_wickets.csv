"yes, it's him! <b>Dilshan</b> takes a superb diving catch at point and yes, it's Warner who has to go! Looked like a bit of extra bounce outside off as Warner checked his jab but did it with hard hands, the bounce takes a good meat of the bat to fly towards point where Dilshan dives low to his left to get both his hands under the ball",31/1,219889,4.5,c Dilshan b Mathews 10 (21m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,David Warner
"big big appeal from Aponso, Aleem Dar raises the finger, Finch has a short chat and walks off without reviewing it. This was looped towards the stumps and Finch tried to defend by covering them all, maybe he played for the turn but the ball angled in and trapped him right in front. Was it headed a bit too much towards leg though?",42/2,5334,7.3,lbw b Aponso 30 (32m 29b 3x4 1x6) SR: 103.44,Aaron Finch
"chipped in the air, <strong>taken at mid-off</strong>! But is it clean? Shaun Marsh wants to hang around as the third umpire is called in and the soft signal is out. It was a fullish delivery outside off, Marsh chipped it half-heartedly down to mid-off where Chandimal dives forward and takes it. A lot of replays being shown for the third umpire, looks like he has got his fingers just under the ball, it's not 100% clear but I think it's out. And the crowd roars as the umpire raises his finger!",44/3,6683,8.5,c Chandimal b Mathews 1 (20m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 12.50,Shaun Marsh
"bowled this time. A wrong shot. And he will not be happy with that. Slides on with the arm from outside off, comes back in and Head goes back to cut. A cry of anguish as missed that. Big wicket. Picked the wrong delivery to go back to.",106/4,530011,22.2, b MDK Perera 36 (49m 48b 5x4 0x6) SR: 75.00,Travis Head
"another stumping appeal and this time the finger has gone up, third umpire not required! Wade tried the sweep yet again but did not connect at all, by the time the ball reached Kusal, Wade was well outside the crease, almost losing balance, with the stretch and Kusal whipped the bails off by the time Wade could drag it back",187/5,230193,38.1,st &dagger;MDKJ Perera b MDK Perera 42 (68m 46b 3x4 0x6) SR: 91.30,Matthew Wade
"it's gone through, Bailey is bowled! The conventional legspinning delivery with some revs on it, it was flighted on leg sutmp and Bailey leaned forward to defend for the turn, bat in front of middle, but it didn't turn and deflected off the front pad to the stumps instead",204/6,4451,41.6, b Prasanna 70 (142m 99b 5x4 0x6) SR: 70.70,George Bailey
"oh my, Faulkner has holed out to deep square leg, the crowd comes alive! Where have these people come from? Unnecessary shot from Faulkner, sweeping the length ball against the turn to the leg side and Dilruwan only had to go a bit to his left to take that comfortably, well inside the boundary",206/7,270484,42.4,c MDK Perera b Aponso 4 (19m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.76,James Faulkner
"gone this time, straight to long-on, yes you read that right! One shot after another Starc has been hitting to long-on, and this time he connects well to hand it to Prasanna who had to go a bit to his right. Good catch in the end",222/8,311592,44.6,c Prasanna b de Silva 12 (11m 8b 1x4 1x6) SR: 150.00,Mitchell Starc
