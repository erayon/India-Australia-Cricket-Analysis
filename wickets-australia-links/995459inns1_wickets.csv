"bowled'im, through the gate! That one pitched on length outside off, and it was the cutter from Starc, it came in after pitching and Gunathilaka's gap between bat and pad was too wide for the ball to sneak through",12/1,345821,2.6, b Starc 2 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Danushka Gunathilaka
"bowled'im around the legs, is he? They are checking with the replays and it shows the ball touched the pad before clipping the leg stump. Lyon around the wicket, pitches it around middle and leg and gets it to turn a bit, Dilshan wanted to work it away gently with the turn but inadvertently exposed his leg stump and the ball got deflected off the thigh pad and onto the stump. ""See you, pal,"" said one of the Australians while crossing Dilshan to congratulate Lyon",12/2,48472,3.1, b Lyon 10 (16m 11b 2x4 0x6) SR: 90.90,Tillakaratne Dilshan
"Wade fails to collect the ball and misses the stumping! Chandimal came down the track to work the ball to leg against the turn but missed it completely! Wade missed it too after the ball clipped the top of the back pad and he now insists on using the review for lbw. Smith calls for the review. Replays show the ball is close to the inside edge of the bat as Chandimal tried to flick on the half-volley, but there's no HotSpot. Third umpire now checking for the rest - it's pitched on leg, it's going straight and it's hitting the stumps. Decision overturned and Wade pumps his fist!",137/3,300628,24.1,lbw b Zampa 48 (88m 67b 2x4 1x6) SR: 71.64,Dinesh Chandimal
"<strong>loud appeal for lbw</strong> with the googly, he's got the big wicket of Kusal Mendis! Nicely tossed up on off stump, Mendis played for the legspin with the front pad in front of the stumps and bat outside the line, but the ball turns in enough to hit him right in front of the stumps. Easy decision, that one and a big breakthrough!",146/4,629074,26.6,lbw b Zampa 69 (104m 69b 9x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Kusal Mendis
"that's number three for Zampa, good low catch from Smith at cover! Flighted as usual outside off, de Silva opened up and drove hard with a big swing, looking to go through the covers, but handed it straight to the captain",158/5,465793,30.2,c Smith b Zampa 7 (15m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 70.00,Dhananjaya de Silva
"loud appeal for lbw from Faulkner - both arms in the air like Akram - and the finger goes up! It was the slower one and absolutely full, hitting Kusal's boot as he tried for another reverse swat, but missed it, taking it in front of middle leg stump",261/6,300631,45.6,lbw b Faulkner 54 (65m 53b 5x4 1x6) SR: 101.88,Kusal Perera
"Faulkner strikes again, Mathews hits this one absolutely straight but long-off catches it just inside the boundary. It was full and straight, Mathews hit through the line but it lacked that extra distance and Henriques ran to his right to catch that safely",279/7,49764,47.1,c Henriques b Faulkner 57 (100m 60b 1x4 2x6) SR: 95.00,Angelo Mathews
"that's a <strong>hat-trick from Faulkner</strong>, he's knocked over the stumps now! Thisara made some room, Faulkner targetted the stumps and beat the batsman who tried to cut but the bat came down too late. And Faulkner, who does it so often in the slog overs, is pulling things back here. Don't forget his performane in the first ODI!",279/8,233514,47.2, b Faulkner 12 (9m 6b 1x4 1x6) SR: 200.00,Thisara Perera
"he's hit the off stump, Starc, you beauty! He bowled that one from wide of the crease with the angle, targetted the off stump with some pace and Dilruwan showed his bat on the wrong line",286/9,49920,48.1, b Starc 5 (6m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125.00,Dilruwan Perera
"Starc takes his third, he's hit the stumps again and SL are bowled out! From wide of the crease again, right in the block hole and through the batsman to hit the middle and leg stumps!",288/10,429748,48.5, b Starc 2 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Amila Aponso
