"of all the balls to fall to. This is full. This is miles down leg. This has boundary written all over it, and Latham tries to oblige, flicking the ball in the air, looking for the fine leg boundary. Instead, he finds the only man there, Josh Hazlewood moving smoothly to his right, diving forward and taking a super catch. So Australia's non-review has cost them, and Starc, absolutely nothing",6/1,388802,2.6,c Hazlewood b Starc 0 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Tom Latham
"what a beauty! Extra bounce, and darting in off the seam too. It's that movement that does him. The ball begins as a short one outside off so Williamson gets a late cut ready, but he is caught off guard because it rears up, cramps him for room and takes a little tickle off the inside edge through to the keeper. Great reward for a probing spell from Cummins.",76/2,277906,14.5,c &dagger;Handscomb b Cummins 36 (51m 42b 5x4 0x6) SR: 85.71,Kane Williamson
"big appeal for caught behind, they're going up with the noise, but could it be bat hitting ground? <b>Australia go for review</b>. It's a very full, very wide delivery, that Brownlie looks to slice off the open face. Chris Brown, the on-field umpire, said no. But snicko points out a spike as the ball passes the bat. Umpire Dharmasena asks the decision to be reversed and so Handscomb has a second catch, this one diving forward to pick up a ball that is dying on his way through to him",176/3,4493,31.5,c &dagger;Handscomb b Faulkner 63 (137m 78b 7x4 0x6) SR: 80.76,Dean Brownlie
"huge nick and umpire Brown says off you go. Hits the seam and kicks up off the pitch. Takes the outside edge at the shoulder of Broom's bat as he comes forward to try and defend. Beautiful bowling, with just a little help from the pitch",198/4,36581,35.6,c &dagger;Handscomb b Faulkner 8 (24m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Neil Broom
"the pressure has told. Munro couldn't get anything away. Not even singles, with the field up. And here, he tries to chip a fuller ball outside off for a few runs but does so in the air. Starc at mid-off, comes forward and dives to complete the formalities",205/5,232359,38.4,c Starc b Hazlewood 3 (11m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Colin Munro
"chops on and Neesham falls. Clever bowling from Australia, they've realised the kind of bowling that will help on this pitch, the cross seamers and slower balls and hitting the deck with the seam. This one climbs a bit more on the batsman and his trying to find runs at third man fails badly. The ball grazes past off stump, the bail takes a long time coming off, but off it comes. Neesham almost thought he had gotten away with it",209/6,355269,40.2, b Hazlewood 1 (8m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28,James Neesham
"pummels it... straight to deep square leg. Taylor walks off to a rousing ovation, but without him, New Zealand have no hope of getting to the kind of score they want. Good bowling from Faulkner, hitting a stump-to-stump line, changing his pace as often as possible",246/7,38699,46.5,c Stoinis b Faulkner 107 (147m 101b 13x4 0x6) SR: 105.94,Ross Taylor
"nothing better for a fast bowler. A searing 146 kph yorker on the base of middle stump and Southee, running away from the ball, leaves it free passage to hit his woodwork. Starc's pitch map today would make fine reading. So many into the blockhole",265/8,232364,49.1, b Starc 10 (12m 8b 0x4 1x6) SR: 125.00,Tim Southee
"another yorker and the stumps are in disarray again. Ferguson's bat just doesn't come down quick enough. Starc just turns around after seeing the bails fly. He wants to get this over with, put his feet up, bag the trophy and go home. Seems to be getting some late away swing as well",265/9,493773,49.2, b Starc 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Lockie Ferguson
