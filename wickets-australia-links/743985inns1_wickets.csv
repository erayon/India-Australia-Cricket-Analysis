"a low full toss, angling into the pads, and up goes the finger again! Blimey, it was a good case for using a second review in the over. The Aussies in the cordon were taunting him to ""use it, go on!"" but he didn't and it was a bad error! Hawkeye shows that was missing leg stump by a distance.",4/1,298438,0.4,lbw b Starc 4 (6m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Jason Roy
"so nearly dropped at point, but grabbed at the second attempt! A horrid scratchy innings comes to an end. That was his first real shot in anger, and it scooted straight at Maxwell's head, who eventually clung onto the second attempt down by his knees",13/2,249866,3.6,c Maxwell b Hastings 4 (20m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Alex Hales
"lovely delivery! Climbed off the deck and Hastings has his reward for perseverance. Taylor's eagerness to put bat on ball is his undoing as he feathers an edge through to Wade, and now England are in serious bother",22/3,297635,5.5,c &dagger;Wade b Hastings 12 (23m 18b 2x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,James Taylor
"yikes, now that is nasty! Morgan is in real trouble as he wears one on the helmet, a perfectly directed bouncer, but the concern on Australia's faces is genuine. The physio and doctor are out there giving him the once-over, but surely he'll have to retire hurt. It was on to him in a flash, and Morgan took his eyes off the ball at the last split-second as he ducked into it",22/3,24598,6.5,retired hurt 1 (14m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66,Eoin Morgan
"massive appeal! Very full, very straight, but given not out ... it's a <strong>review</strong>.... no bat involved, now then, is it hitting leg full enough, indeed it is! That's out!",56/4,297433,13.3,lbw b Marsh 10 (29m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Jonny Bairstow
"a gloriously Gower-esque departure from Moeen Ali, as if to prove the earlier point! He played the shot on merit, but the upshot is an edge to the keeper and a rather desperate scoreline",72/5,8917,17.1,c &dagger;Wade b Marsh 5 (16m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Moeen Ali
"hit on the pads, huge appeal from Marsh... and Bailey's finger goes up! Is that another one gone? Willey asks for the <b>review</b>, this is going to depend on whether the ball pitched in line... and Hawk-Eye says it did, bang on and straightening, would have shuddered the top of leg stump! England are six (effectively seven) down!",72/6,308251,17.3,lbw b Marsh 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,David Willey
"struck on the pads, up goes the finger - Stokes is a goner, too! Very similar to the Willey dismissal, hit on the knee roll around the line of leg stump, umpire Bailey doesn't take long to make his decision and England have no more reviews. It looked a good appeal at first glance... Captain/Agent Smith and his men have snuffed out Stokes after a feisty knock",85/7,311158,19.6,lbw b Marsh 42 (71m 51b 6x4 1x6) SR: 82.35,Ben Stokes
Wood tries to launch Hasting into the stands and picks out deep extra cover! His merry thrash comes to a predictably quick finish and John Hastings has three-for in an ODI for the first time,106/8,351588,23.1,c Agar b Hastings 13 (15m 13b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Mark Wood
"pinned in front and that's all over, red rover! The simplest lbw decision of the day, Topley playing back to one that gripped a little and straightened on off stump, plumb as a pudding",138/9,461632,32.6,lbw b Agar 6 (38m 27b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22,Reece Topley
