"gone! Another drive in the air, but this time he's hit it too close to cover, who takes it well, low, in both hands, diving forward. Taylor did well to bowl it full again, but not as wide as the previous ball, and Finch pushed hard at it, way out in front of his body",30/1,5334,3.6,c Coleman b Taylor 20 (14m 10b 3x4 1x6) SR: 200.00,Aaron Finch
"got him. Slower ball, angling down leg. Watson goes for the lap-sweep, and ends up top-edging it, loops into the keeper's gloves, he only had to move a short way to his left",88/2,8180,12.6,c &dagger;Cross b Davey 24 (36m 23b 4x4 0x6) SR: 104.34,Shane Watson
"taken! That's brilliant from Leask at the deep square leg boundary. It was short again, angling into the body, and Clarke pulled it in the air, to the fielder's right. Sprints quickly across, and throws himself across to come up with the ball in his right hand",92/3,4578,13.2,c Leask b Wardlaw 47 (55m 47b 7x4 2x6) SR: 100.00,Michael Clarke
