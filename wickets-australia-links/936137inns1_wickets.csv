"a big heave down the ground, it looks elegant enough, but he's not middled it at all! Right off the toe, a gentle back-pedal at mid-on, and Australia have the breakthrough!",70/1,379143,10.6,c Tremain b Hastings 22 (44m 24b 2x4 0x6) SR: 91.66,Quinton de Kock
"shortish and Rossouw pulls, sends it swirling into the Joburg atmosphere - taken at deep square leg! Not the most calculated of risks, looked like a long boundary out that direction and it was well short of carrying, Hastings again the bowler to strike. Looks like it was a cross-seamer that did for Rossouw... and a bit of a lucky take from Worrall, the sub fielder, as it went through the hands but landed in his lap",146/2,318845,24.1,c sub (DJ Worrall) b Hastings 75 (105m 81b 10x4 0x6) SR: 92.59,Rilee Rossouw
"finally, the breakthrough! Marsh serves up the offcutter and Duminy, on the charge, chops onto his stumps! He died by his own sword there, but it was thrilling acceleration while it lasted",296/3,44932,41.6, b Marsh 82 (77m 58b 10x4 3x6) SR: 141.37,Jean-Paul Duminy
"nailed out to cow corner, but Smith is well placed and du Plessis has picked out the man, five metres in from the rope! The skipper departs as Australia regain a toe-hold in the final overs",308/4,44828,43.2,c Smith b Marsh 111 (146m 93b 13x4 0x6) SR: 119.35,Faf du Plessis
"heaved hard and violently out to deep midwicket! Tremain has his maiden ODI wicket, and it's come at a vital moment! Got right under the shot and gave Warner several decades to contemplate the ball as it fell back to earth. But he judged it just fine and South Africa's charge still hasn't quite materialised",334/5,44410,47.1,c Warner b Tremain 13 (17m 14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 92.85,Farhaan Behardien
"chopped hard out to point, and a tumbling stop ... in fact, it's a catch! Zampa reacted so calmly that no-one really noticed it was out. The umpires are taking a look, and lo and behold, the ball buried in his breadbasket! Time is called on Miller Time...",347/6,321777,48.2,c Zampa b Hastings 26 (33m 17b 4x4 0x6) SR: 152.94,David Miller
