"chipped to mid-off, Parnell strikes! Maybe stopped in the pitch a fraction... Certainly Warner was not on top of a regulation check drive, looped off the face of the bat and Phehlukwayo held on running to his right. All going off in Parnell's opening over",64/1,219889,9.3,c Phehlukwayo b Parnell 40 (41m 36b 5x4 1x6) SR: 111.11,David Warner
"short ball, flicked off the body in the air, Parnell throws himself forward at short fine leg... but did it carry? The SA fielders think so but Finch stands his ground and the third umpire will have to make a call on this. It was a tumbling effort on the edge of the ring, looks on first glance that he managed to get his fingers under the ball; but, with the number of replays being looked at by Nigel Llong, we're into the realms of foreshortening. But no, it's given! Think that's the right call, in real time Parnell appeared to have scooped it up from above the turf. Phehlukwayo - surely time we nicknamed him ""Lucky"" - gets his wicket",88/2,5334,12.1,c Parnell b Phehlukwayo 33 (57m 28b 4x4 2x6) SR: 117.85,Aaron Finch
"fuller, straighter, rattling into the pads... up goes the finger! Smith seemed to simply misjudge the length, caught on the crease trying to glance to leg, but he <b>reviews</b> the decision, hoping for a reprieve. No chance, that's hitting middle and leg, Smith is out! Two in the over for ""Lucky""!",90/3,267192,12.4,lbw b Phehlukwayo 8 (21m 11b 2x4 0x6) SR: 72.72,Steven Smith
"edged, and stunningly caught by a one-handed de Kock behind the stumps! The extra delivery pays dividends, as Marsh hangs back in the crease, is drawn into a loose poke by the extra bounce, and the keeper snaffles it almost in slow motion, high to his right! Lucky strikes again! Trebles all round!",131/4,272450,18.6,c &dagger;de Kock b Phehlukwayo 31 (28m 25b 5x4 1x6) SR: 124.00,Mitchell Marsh
"that is tremendous wrist-spin bowling. Beautiful flight, luring Head out of the crease, dipping late, and lo and behold, it's the googly to boot. Zips past a flailing edge like a winger side-stepping the fullback, and off come the bails!",172/5,530011,25.5,st &dagger;de Kock b Imran Tahir 18 (25m 18b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Travis Head
"on the pads, clipped to midwicket and David Miller, on the dive, smashes the stumps at the non-striker's end with Wade nowhere close to the picture! Outstanding sharp work and a vital breakthrough",192/6,230193,28.5,run out (Miller) 5 (14m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Matthew Wade
"got him, launched down the ground but straight to long-off, picked him out perfectly! He's got the touch today, Phehlukwayo strikes first ball - bowled for and got, I'm sure. Hastings' defiant rearguard some to an end",271/7,228622,45.1,c Behardien b Phehlukwayo 51 (63m 56b 6x4 2x6) SR: 91.07,John Hastings
"the slower ball does him! Bailey gets right underneath it and slogs to mid-on, all height and no trousers, Australia's linchpin falls! Still almost three overs to go but Bailey had to try and get on with it if they are to breach 300",278/8,4451,47.1,c Miller b Steyn 74 (146m 90b 7x4 2x6) SR: 82.22,George Bailey
"scooped straight up and taken at mid-on! Second wicket for Dale Steyn, a carbon copy of Bailey's dismissal, the cutter too cute for Zampa and it's catching practice for Miller on the edge of the circle",286/9,379504,49.1,c Miller b Steyn 12 (21m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 63.15,Adam Zampa
