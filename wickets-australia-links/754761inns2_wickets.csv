"super reaction from Haddin after a peach from Hazlewood, hits the track short of a length, just about holds the line, bang on the line of the stumps too, Bell has to play, and Haddin sticks out a hand as he falls to his right to pouch it",18/1,9062,3.3,c &dagger;Haddin b Hazlewood 8 (13m 9b 2x4 0x6) SR: 88.88,Ian Bell
"Johnson strikes, via a sharp take from Maxwell, Taylor reaches for the drive at a good length delivery leaving him on the angle, he can't keep it down, Maxwell goes down on his left and stretches to take it low at backward point, they check for the no ball, it is tight, but it is settled in favour of the bowler",35/2,297635,8.1,c Maxwell b Johnson 4 (20m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22,James Taylor
"and out of nowhere, he comes up with a snorter on target, Moeen can only fend this to wide slip, short ball, climbing steeply on off, Moeen can't avoid that, tries to ride the bounce and survive, fails",46/3,8917,10.3,c Finch b Johnson 26 (44m 30b 5x4 0x6) SR: 86.66,Moeen Ali

"and he breaks through immediately, it is his day, what a delivery first up, no warm up business, yorker, full and straight, Root misses with the clip, pad is in the way of the stumps, agrees the umpire, that is taking out middle",71/5,303669,19.1,lbw b Faulkner 25 (46m 37b 2x4 0x6) SR: 67.56,Joe Root
"Maxwell not only hits reverse sweeps, he also gets batsmen on the shot, Pat Cummins the substitute at short third man, throws himself forward to take it low, helps that he is quite tall, of course",98/6,308967,24.1,c sub (PJ Cummins) b Maxwell 17 (20m 22b 3x4 0x6) SR: 77.27,Jos Buttler
"and now he is on a hat-trick too, Glenn Maxwell, how soft is this, Woakes has leaned forward and just popped back this offbreak straight to the bowler, horror game for Woakes this, 0 for 89, and now this",98/7,247235,24.2,c &amp; b Maxwell 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Chris Woakes
