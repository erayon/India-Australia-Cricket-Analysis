"pitched up, this jags back at Finch and raps him on the pads, Sohail implores for the decision... and Dharmasena gives it! Finch, after a brief conversation with his partner, asks for the <b>review</b> but it only takes a quick look to release this was foolishness. Not much footwork and the ball zipped in with the arm, past the inside edge as he played to leg, and it was crashing into the woodwork halfway up. The finger points skywards for a second time and Pakistan celebrate to the heavens",15/1,5334,2.3,lbw b Sohail Khan 2 (11m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Aaron Finch
"banged in, short and wide... and Warner has flubbed it straight to third man! Wahab strikes, his 15th wicket of the tournament to go joint third. Warner has gifted him this one, though, was trying to use the pace but really just hung the bat out and steered an uppercut to the fielder, decent low catch from Rahat who ran in a good way",49/2,219889,8.3,c Rahat Ali b Wahab Riaz 24 (41m 23b 3x4 0x6) SR: 104.34,David Warner
"gottim! The short ball works, Clarke dollies it to forward short leg! Don't you love it when a plan comes together... That was well-directed from Wahab, not quite a snorter but awkward enough for a man with an antique spine, rising towards the helmet grill and Clarke can only pop it up off the splice, floats into the hands of the catcher. Maqsood hurls the ball at the floor and screams in delight. Pakistan are <i>in</i> this",59/3,4578,10.4,c Sohaib Maqsood b Wahab Riaz 8 (10m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 72.72,Michael Clarke
"fuller, on the stumps, Smith flicks and misses - given! Adil's appeal was almost a lone one, though Sarfraz also went up, Dharmasena gave it some thought before raising the finger. Australia have used their review, so Smith has to trudge off, having looked impenetrable for the last couple of hours. Looked like it would have clipped leg, fairly innocuous ball, Smith not quite as focused as he had been",148/4,267192,26.4,lbw b Ehsan Adil 65 (115m 69b 7x4 0x6) SR: 94.20,Steven Smith
