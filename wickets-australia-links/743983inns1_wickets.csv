"angled across, Burns prods at it... and plays on to his stumps! An unconvincing stay from Burns, didn't really get a feel for ball on bat and this time a fraction of inward movement results in a drag-on. The ball was not quite there to cut, no real conviction in the shot",14/1,326632,2.5, b Willey 2 (10m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57,Joe Burns
"pinned in front, Smith falling over his feet - gone! A corking delivery, right up in the blockhole and Smith failed to get bat on it this time as he swung across the line, hit on the back foot plumb in front of middle and off, the ball curving back beautifully... Thinks about a review but instead decides to take his medicine and head for the dressing room",25/2,267192,6.2,lbw b Willey 5 (15m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 41.66,Steven Smith
"goes on with the arm, Finch feels for it and nicks off! Willey fell over in his follow through and had to appeal from the floor - but it's Australia who looking unsteady on their feet, three down for spit. Willey has been mixing up inswingers with bother-balls in the channel, Finch wasn't quite sure what was coming and just got a thin snick through to Bairstow",30/3,5334,8.3,c &dagger;Bairstow b Willey 15 (37m 27b 2x4 0x6) SR: 55.55,Aaron Finch
"speared in and leg stump is pegged back, Maxwell bowled trying to reverse-sweep! The onslaught is over, a reversey Percy too many, though it's a surprise that Maxwell got it wrong rather than Bailey... The ball was straight and skipped under the bat as Maxwell aimed another swingeing swat through point",167/4,325026,29.4, b Ali 85 (81m 64b 10x4 2x6) SR: 132.81,Glenn Maxwell
"full, straight, chipped high and hard but only as far as David Willey at long-off who took a well-judged catch in the deep. Instant strike for England and that target of 300 takes a touch of a dent",210/5,272450,40.1,c Willey b Plunkett 17 (32m 24b 0x4 0x6) SR: 70.83,Mitchell Marsh
"gosh, now that changes things! Bailey was early onto the drive, the ball stopped in the pitch, popped up off the bat sticker, and straight back into the bowler's grateful mitts! England, it is fair to say, are bossing this Powerplay.",210/6,4451,40.3,c &amp; b Plunkett 75 (126m 110b 6x4 1x6) SR: 68.18,George Bailey
"reverse sweep, and Australia have lost their third wicket in ten balls! Stoinis drops to one knee, attempts to pick the gap, but merely picks out gully instead! A disappointing debut ends. With the bat at least ...",215/7,325012,41.4,c Rashid b Ali 4 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Marcus Stoinis
