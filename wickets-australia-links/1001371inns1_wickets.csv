"135 kph, Finch has chopped on. That movement again. Henry keeps this full, the ball moves back in. Finch doesn't care. He goes on with an exuberant on-the-up drive with his feet rooted in the crease. What that does is create a massive gap between bat and pad. The ball deviates in, takes the inside edge and clatters into leg stump. Not a great shot first ball. Excellent bowling from Henry. Just a little bit of movement, more than enough at this level.",1/1,5334,0.3, b Henry 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Aaron Finch
"148 kph, and <strong>Ferguson has a wicket in his first over in international cricket.</strong> Good length outside off, the ball moves away just a touch. Warner hangs his bat out, looking to get one down to third man. The ball takes the inside edge and hits the off stump. The second chop-on dismissal this afternoon. Another loose, lazy stroke. A bit of complacency in that shot",47/2,219889,9.6, b Ferguson 24 (43m 29b 4x4 0x6) SR: 82.75,David Warner
"umpire Dharmasena checking if it has carried. That looked like it did. The third umpire is being called. <strong>Soft signal is out. </strong>Bailey trudging off. Goes in cleanly. And that will be the end of Bailey. Quite a terrible delivery, full down leg. Bailey gets a little bit of bat on that, carries low to Watling's left who gets across and takes it with both hands. A lucky wicket for NZ.",89/3,4451,18.6,c &dagger;Watling b Neesham 17 (35m 25b 0x4 1x6) SR: 68.00,George Bailey
"gone! Marsh is run-out at the non-strikers end. Punches his bat in disgust. Full delivery on off, Smith drives it crisply and cleanly back at the bowler's right. Neesham mis-fields but gets his hands to the ball. It ricochets slightly but into the non-strikers stumps. Marsh was backing up and has been caught more than a few feet short of his crease",92/4,272450,20.1,run out (Neesham) 1 (6m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Mitchell Marsh
"Boult returns and finds a way past Smith and Head. He dives to his right from his follow-through and plucks out a smart, low catch with both hands. Full and angled in on off, possibly stopped a bit on the left-hander. He pushes in the air, and ends up lobbing a return catch. Excellent reflex catch",219/5,530011,41.1,c &amp; b Boult 52 (88m 60b 5x4 0x6) SR: 86.66,Travis Head
"Munro hangs onto a skier, Smith walks back to a standing ovation. Rousing reception for Smith from his home crowd. Williamson, Santner, and Guptill also congratulate Smith on his landmark. Back of a length and outside off, Smith has a hack at it, skews it in the air with the bottom hand flying off the bat. Munro was probably late again, he moves to his left from square leg and completes a diving catch at the midwicket region. Smith exits with <a href=""http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;ground=132;template=results;type=batting;view=innings"" target=""_blank"">164, the highest individual ODI score at the SCG</a>",302/6,267192,47.2,c Munro b Boult 164 (206m 157b 14x4 4x6) SR: 104.45,Steven Smith
"Wade attempts another scoop, he only deflects it onto the stumps. Nice and full, outside off. Wade, having shuffled across, can't get enough bat on it. The zing bails go flying. He was looking to play it fine of fine leg, who had been brought up",311/7,230193,48.5, b Henry 38 (42m 22b 1x4 3x6) SR: 172.72,Matthew Wade
"polite appeal for caught behind from Watling. Given out by umpire Martell. Did the brush the glove on its way? Or just the helmet? Starc challenges the on-field decision. Big bouncer on middle, the batsman was late on the hook. Grazes the top edge, then the helmet and then flies into the gloves of Watling down the leg side. Hotspot detects a white blotch on the bat and the helmet. Snicko picks up a spike too as the bat meets the ball",322/8,311592,49.4,c &dagger;Watling b Neesham 11 (6m 5b 2x4 0x6) SR: 220.00,Mitchell Starc
