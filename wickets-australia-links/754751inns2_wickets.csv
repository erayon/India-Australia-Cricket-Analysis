"he's chopped it on, Finch is gone! Finch didn't move much for the ball that held its line after pitching outside off on back of length, he stayed back to punch it on the off side but got an inside edge that took his off stump",33/1,5334,6.2, b Woakes 15 (24m 18b 3x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Aaron Finch
"Watson pulls again but is caught this time, very good catch by Woakes running in from deep midwicket! Watson pulled the short ball from just outside off and it went very high, Moeen was running in from deep square leg and Woakes from deep midwicket and the latter ran in a long way to grab it with both hands",71/2,8180,12.4,c Woakes b Jordan 16 (27m 20b 2x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Shane Watson

"there's a loud appeal for caught behind and he's gone! It was a fullish delivery outside off, Maxi poked without much footwork, the keeper and bowler went up and so did the umpire's finger! But replays and HotSpot confirm there was no edge, the sound was of the bat hitting the ground",200/5,325026,36.5,c &dagger;Buttler b Woakes 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Glenn Maxwell
