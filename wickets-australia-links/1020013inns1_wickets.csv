"early birthday present for the big left-arm quick! This is a shortish delivery, heading down leg. Latham felt he could just ride it, nudge it to fine leg and get off strike, but he may have been undone by a little extra bounce. Cramped for room, with the ball suddenly big on him, he looks all kinds of awkward, gloving through to Handscomb, the stand-in wicketkeeper. Happy 27th, fella",13/1,388802,2.5,c &dagger;Handscomb b Starc 7 (14m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 77.77,Tom Latham
"bat-pad catch to backward point running to his left. Big appeal from Stoinis and the keeper. Umpire Knights' finger goes up. Stoinis snaffles Williamson in his first over. Back of a length and angled in at off stump, kicks up, Williamson jumps off the ground and seeks to work the ball to the leg side. The ball grazes the inside edge, then the thigh pad, and pops up to Maxwell. Williamson is Stonis' maiden one-day international victim. How about that for a start? Not sure if that was the cutter from Stoinis - he can bowl a cunning offcutter which bounces at the batsman",87/2,277906,13.6,c Maxwell b Stoinis 24 (48m 34b 2x4 0x6) SR: 70.58,Kane Williamson
"too full for the sweep and Taylor drags it back onto the stumps. Tossed up and angling across off, wide outside off, Taylor goes low and makes a mess of the sweep. Head reaps reward for some tight bowling",128/3,38699,22.3, b Head 16 (38m 24b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66,Ross Taylor
"bowled'em. Stoinis has nabbed both Williamson and Guptill. Sneaks through the gate. Half-volley length, bowled from wide of the crease, right up there to be laced through the covers. Guptill attempts a drive, but the ball cuts back in slightly and goes through the defences. Hits middle and leg stumps with the offcutter",130/4,226492,23.4, b Stoinis 61 (107m 73b 8x4 0x6) SR: 83.56,Martin Guptill
"length and outside off, Munro shovels it in the air off the inside half and hands a loopy catch to Finch. Not a full-blooded hit from the left-hander. He aimed to clear mid-on, instead chipped it to Australia's captain. So Handscomb's drop costs Australia just one run",134/5,232359,25.1,c Finch b Stoinis 2 (6m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Colin Munro
"top edge as he pulls and deep midwicket takes a simple catch. Excellent time for a wicket and it comes from their Mr Dependable. Simple, back of a length, not much room to free the arms. Neesham tries to make a bit too much of it and mistimes his shot. Head steadies himself a few yards inside the fence and takes it well",210/6,355269,37.6,c Head b Hazlewood 48 (58m 45b 6x4 0x6) SR: 106.66,James Neesham
"what a shot, but oh, there's a fielder there, it's Maxwell, and its a stunning catch! Flashes a little grin after running several yards to his right, eyes always on the ball, taking it cleanly as he bends low and then gets into a military-style roll with the momentum he had going. Top effort. And one of the few times Santner times the ball, and he did so well to back away to make his own room against a good short ball",246/7,502714,45.2,c Maxwell b Cummins 7 (34m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 36.84,Mitchell Santner
"backs away and goes for the upper cut and he hasn't got enough on it. Third man comes up off the boundary, steadies himself and takes a good catch. Faulkner the man there",251/8,232364,45.5,c Faulkner b Cummins 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Tim Southee
"comes down the track and hoists a back of the hand slower ball on leg stump to long-on. End of a fine innings from Broom, who has basically had to fight all on his lonesome all through the middle overs",269/9,36581,48.4,c Starc b Faulkner 73 (120m 75b 4x4 3x6) SR: 97.33,Neil Broom
