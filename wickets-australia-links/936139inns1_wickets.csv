"launched into the sky, but it lobs to mid-off, Tahir makes the breakthrough! One big hit too many for Finch, sent it pretty much straight up and he has to head straight off, as Tahir weaves away in trademark arms-whirling high-fiving celebration. Twas the googly that did it",110/1,5334,13.1,c Rabada b Imran Tahir 53 (55m 34b 3x4 4x6) SR: 155.88,Aaron Finch
"slogs again, but this one won't clear the rope... well taken by long-on running in! Tahir finally induces another mistake, having got Finch earlier, but Warner has played a superb knock. Was looking to plant Tahir into the stands again but went pretty much straight up",234/2,219889,34.5,c Duminy b Imran Tahir 117 (139m 107b 13x4 2x6) SR: 109.34,David Warner
"got him, brilliant catch in the covers! Lucky's slower ball does the trick, though Bailey must have thought he'd collared it, opening the shoulders and slapping in front of square, only for du Plessis to hurl himself to his left and cling on to a pearler two-handed",280/3,4451,40.5,c du Plessis b Phehlukwayo 28 (27m 18b 1x4 1x6) SR: 155.55,George Bailey
"short ball, Marsh cracks a pull... only to be bagged by another great catch at midwicket! Miller the man on this occasion, diving low to his left and clinging on to give Steyn a wicket and just check Australia's momentum a fraction",300/4,272450,44.2,c Miller b Steyn 2 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,Mitchell Marsh
"bowled him, Smith misses a slower ball! He tucks his bat under his arm and walks off, a fantastic knock but he won't go any further... Made a bit of room and was looking to steer through the covers, done by the lack of pace as Steyn sent a cutter into off stump",325/5,267192,46.2, b Steyn 108 (136m 107b 9x4 1x6) SR: 100.93,Steven Smith
"full toss to finish and Head top-edges a slog pretty much straight up, Rabada running across to his right to take the catch - although he almost collides with du Plessis running in from cover! They check the delivery for height but it's <i>just</i> the right side of a no-ball, so the innings finishes with a wicket, Head and Wade's rambunctious partnership finally curtailed",371/6,530011,49.6,c &amp; b Rabada 35 (27m 18b 4x4 1x6) SR: 194.44,Travis Head
