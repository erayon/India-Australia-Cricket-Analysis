"gone, gone. Full outside off, and Sharjeel has been struggling for timing right through this innings. Doesn't connect cleanly with his hit down the ground, gets neither the desired elevation nor placement, and he hits it straight to Maxwell at mid-on",38/1,227762,8.1,c Maxwell b Faulkner 18 (45m 22b 1x4 1x6) SR: 81.81,Sharjeel Khan
"Whoops, not a great shot. Excellent length from Faulkner, inviting the drive without necessarily being driveable. Bowls it wide enough to entice Hafeez into the shot. Doesn't get his weight into it in time, is a little late getting fully forward, and only manages a thin edge",47/2,41434,10.1,c &dagger;Wade b Faulkner 4 (11m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14,Mohammad Hafeez
"gone! Akmal has played another terrible stroke. What was he trying to do? Clear mid-on with a pull? Poor choice of stroke. Back of a length from Starc outside off, hustles Akmal for pace. Akmal tries to forehand the ball into the leg side but may have been too late to the ball. Splices the ball straight to mid-on, who takes an easy catch. Ooh, actually that may have been the offcutter.",79/3,317273,16.5,c Head b Starc 17 (29m 25b 3x4 0x6) SR: 68.00,Umar Akmal
"Azam was looking so good, then he does this. A stroke fraught with so much risk with a slip in place. Back of a length from Cummins, seaming back in. Azam tries to steer the ball to third man for one. The inward movement helps the ball rap the glove and just lob to Smith at slip. An easy catch. But well bowled too. Got some bounce and extra oomph in his delivery.",109/4,348144,25.5,c Smith b Cummins 33 (70m 46b 3x4 0x6) SR: 71.73,Babar Azam
"And a wicket, immediately. Bangs it in. Rizwan has to pull from over his right shoulder, and he takes it on, ends up skewing it high, and Marsh, running to his left from deep midwicket, takes an excellent catch. He reaches overhead with both hands, first, then the ball bounces out, and he manages to catch it on the rebound, with his left hand, while tumbling to the floor",129/5,323389,30.1,c Marsh b Cummins 21 (53m 44b 0x4 0x6) SR: 47.72,Mohammad Rizwan
"bowled him! It was threatening to happen all through this over, and Starc finally gets one in the perfect spot. Full, swinging in, not a yorker, though. Nawaz slogs and misses, Starc hits off stump",133/6,348148,32.5, b Starc 1 (10m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.11,Mohammad Nawaz
"gone. Slower short ball, and Imad can't get any real power on this pull. Hits it high, towards Warner, who runs in from the midwicket boundary to complete a simple catch",158/7,227758,38.3,c Warner b Marsh 29 (54m 36b 1x4 1x6) SR: 80.55,Imad Wasim
"and he goes next ball. Looks to manufacture a shot off a length ball angling into him. Wants to hit that over short leg, I guess, but it's the slower ball, and he's through his shot too early and hits it down the throat of Warner running in from deep square leg",163/8,39037,39.6,c Warner b Faulkner 24 (78m 48b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Azhar Ali
"another slower ball, another swipe from Amir, wanting to hit over the covers. He manages to hit it in the intended direction, but without the intended power, and extra-cover takes a couple of steps back and lets the ball fall into his cupped hands",171/9,290948,41.4,c Maxwell b Faulkner 8 (14m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Mohammad Amir
"length ball, slower ball, wide of off stump. Wahab slogs, he has to. Wants to hit over mid-off, but again, can't get any power into it. Mid-off moves a few steps to his left and backwards, and takes a comfortable catch to wrap up a 92-run win",176/10,43590,42.4,c Starc b Cummins 6 (12m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 75.00,Wahab Riaz
