Anderson stays in the crease again and looks to turn the ball into the off-side. Gets hit on the pad and the umpire's finger goes up. Anderson reviews the decision. No bat on the ball and it does look a touch high. It bounces in line and it's just clipping the top of the bails. It's the umpire's call and Anderson has to go,121/3,44014,23.6,lbw b Boland 39 (67m 49b 6x4 0x6) SR: 79.59,John Anderson

What's happened here? Terry gets hit on the pads and Worrell goes up for the LBW. Terry wanders out of the crease and the ball gets thrown back in from slip and Terry is run out.
