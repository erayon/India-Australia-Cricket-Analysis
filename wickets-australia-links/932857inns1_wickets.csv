"swing and bounce! Finch has nicked off for a duck. He inspects the pitch as he walks off. Good length and nibbles away a touch outside off, Holder's height means that he generates extra bounce. Finch has a weak waft, pressing forward at it, and edges it to lone slip. It actually popped off the shoulder of the bat to Benn. Big lift! He takes it just below his chest",1/1,5334,0.4,c Benn b Holder 0 (4m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Aaron Finch
"taken! Smith goes. Superb bowling previously has led to a wicket for Brathwaite. A legcutter this time, quite full and wide outside off. Smith looks to execute an ugly drag-sweep into the leg side but the ball is top-edged and goes straight in the air. Hangs there for quite awhile, Brathwaite calls, settles himself under it and takes a good catch, hands reverse-cupped",171/2,267192,34.1,c &amp; b Brathwaite 74 (135m 95b 5x4 2x6) SR: 77.89,Steven Smith
"Bailey employs the reverse sweep and sends it past lone slip. It trickles away to third man.... Taylor dishes in the chase, and fires a flat throw to the stand-in keeper. Fletcher did well to gather the ball and break the stumps. The left-hander is short on the third. <strong>Khawaja falls two short of a century</strong>. His running had been tentative throughout his stay. Khawaja called for the three, he perhaps needed a full-length dive",196/3,215155,40.5,run out (Taylor/Fletcher) 98 (178m 123b 4x4 3x6) SR: 79.67,Usman Khawaja
"low full toss on off, Marsh gives it away. The bat twisted in his hands and he ends up slicing it into the hands of Holder at mid-off",245/4,272450,46.5,c Holder b Brathwaite 16 (27m 16b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Mitchell Marsh
Head skies this offcutter to the keeper. Ramdin settles under it comfortably. Full and leaves the left-hander outside off. Head winds up for a roundhouse swipe. He watches the top edge lodge in the gloves of Ramdin,249/5,530011,47.5,c &dagger;Ramdin b Pollard 1 (5m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Travis Head
The middle stump is floored. Holder pumps his fist. Wade cleared his front leg and shimmied out for a drill down the ground. This yorker shatters the middle stump. No cameo from Wade. Holder caps his spell with a wicket,257/6,230193,48.6, b Holder 5 (6m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 166.66,Matthew Wade
Another wicket for KP. He is pumped. Bailey jumps outside leg again. Pollard sends in an offcutter chasing the batsman. He shapes to pull and ends up top-edging it to the short midwicket region. Ramdin with the big gloves calls for the catch and completes it,259/7,4451,49.2,c &dagger;Ramdin b Pollard 55 (77m 56b 1x4 2x6) SR: 98.21,George Bailey
