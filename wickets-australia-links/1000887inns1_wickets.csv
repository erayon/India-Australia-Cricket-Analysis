"what a delivery! He has been doing it all afternoon. Superb bowling. Amir pushes this one fuller and straighter. Warner sees something on middle and chooses to flick into the leg side but is undone by substantial away swing. The ball beats the flick by some distance and clips the top of the bails. Wow, he wasn't close to that. Not a great shot.",13/1,219889,4.3, b Mohammad Amir 7 (19m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.88,David Warner
"edged and gone! Another peach from Amir. Fantastic captaincy from Azhar, after all the flak he's received. Bowls it full and wide. Asks Smith to drive through the vacant cover region. Smith can't say no with his form, can he? His feet are rooted in the crease, his drive is away from his body. The ball holds its line outside off and takes the edge. A routine catch for Rizwan.",13/2,267192,4.4,c &dagger;Mohammad Rizwan b Mohammad Amir 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Steven Smith
"that isn't a great shot and Lynn falls. Another BBL stroke. Slower delivery this time, full and wide. Lynn just chooses the wrong shot. Premeditated. Could have clattered that over the off side, but he got down on one knee and slog-swept a drag-flick straight into the air. Rizwan runs around, doesn't look to comfortable underneath the skier but importantly, takes the catch. Had to drag that from too wide.",52/3,326637,9.2,c &dagger;Mohammad Rizwan b Hasan Ali 16 (24m 12b 0x4 1x6) SR: 133.33,Chris Lynn
"edged and gone. Wasim strikes. Pakistan chipping away. Head looked all at sea against the non-turning spin of Wasim. A flat delivery outside off, skids on with the arm again. Head looks to slap a drive through cover but plays inside the line, like he has been doing against Wasim. The ball kisses the outside edge and settles in Rizwan's gloves. Good catch too",67/4,530011,12.6,c &dagger;Mohammad Rizwan b Imad Wasim 39 (61m 39b 5x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Travis Head
"this time there is some turn, and Marsh nicks off! That excellent length again, never quite up there to drive, on off stump. Marsh chances the drive, and only manages a thin edge through to Rizwan",78/5,272450,16.2,c &dagger;Mohammad Rizwan b Imad Wasim 4 (30m 17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.52,Mitchell Marsh
"gone! Hasan Ali has varied his pace beautifully in this over, and he does Maxwell with another little offcutter. Looks to flick it over midwicket, is through his shot too early, and it loops up off the high part of his bat and midwicket takes the simplest of catches",160/6,325026,30.6,c Mohammad Hafeez b Hasan Ali 60 (77m 56b 7x4 0x6) SR: 107.14,Glenn Maxwell
"90 kph, edged and gone. Faulkner falls. Pakistan strike again. Good captaincy to have the slip in place and Faulkner edges behind. A lovely length, shortish but close to off, Extracts a bit if turn, Faulkner plays away from his body and gets a thick outside edge which is well held by Hafeez at first slip, to his left. That came quickly.",170/7,270484,33.6,c Mohammad Hafeez b Mohammad Nawaz 5 (13m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 41.66,James Faulkner
"run-out! A total breakdown in communication. Cummins dabbed to point, called yes and stopped. Wade responded to Cummins' initial call and kept going. Akmal picked up cleanly at point and threw the ball back to Amir, who had returned to the stumps to collect the ball. He takes off the bails and Cummins is well short. A good piece of fielding.",212/8,489889,42.5,run out (Umar Akmal/Mohammad Amir) 15 (35m 32b 0x4 0x6) SR: 46.87,Pat Cummins
"cleans 'im up. An offcutter that doesn't cut. Full and straight from Hasan Ali. Starc is nowhere near the ball as he misses his flick. The zing bails fly everywhere. Excellent bowling, totally deceived him with a change-down in pace",235/9,311592,45.4, b Hasan Ali 10 (15m 8b 0x4 1x6) SR: 125.00,Mitchell Starc
