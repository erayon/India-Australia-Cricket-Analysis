"Good length, angles it in, and seams back into Amla. He shuffles across and back as he rapped on the back leg in front of middle and leg stumps. The finger goes up, and Tremain has broken through with the new ball",8/1,43906,2.2,lbw b Tremain 4 (8m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Hashim Amla
"Qdk seeks to clear deep midwicket. He ends up <strong>holing out </strong>to the fielder. Shortish and just outside off, he gets inside the line. Picks it up and pulls crisply into the lap of Zampa",29/2,379143,6.1,c Zampa b Tremain 18 (27m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 128.57,Quinton de Kock
"straight to mid-off. I just despise that shot, but these guys apparently don't. Tossed up on off, Duminy tries to clear mid-off. Doesn't quite get underneath and ends up chipping his wicket away after doing all the hardwork. All he had to do was try to go straight and the margin of error increases multi-fold. Nonetheless, Marsh takes a simple reverse-cupped catch",85/3,44932,19.4,c Marsh b Zampa 25 (53m 45b 4x4 0x6) SR: 55.55,Jean-Paul Duminy
"Faf finds deep midwicket! Dug in short on off, Faf shapes to pull. Doesn't hit it as well as he would have liked. Head takes it safely at the edge of the boundary. Faf falls, but SA have all but sewn up this game",140/4,44828,30.4,c Head b Marsh 69 (126m 87b 8x4 0x6) SR: 79.31,Faf du Plessis
