"searing in at Warner and his stumps are toppled! It was the cross-seamer, like the previous ball, only it still manages to swing. Beats him for pace, beats him for movement and sends him back. Big strike for England, and what was the length?",57/1,219889,7.3, b Broad 22 (34m 18b 3x4 0x6) SR: 122.22,David Warner
"it just had to happen, right? MCG, big, raucous crowd, Broad is in his element! Terrific length and the line is impeccable on off stump. Brings the batsman forward and jags the ball away, steals the outside edge and the keeper does the rest. England are right back in it!",57/2,8180,7.4,c &dagger;Buttler b Broad 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Shane Watson
"inswing! Beautiful inswing! Gets the inside edge, knocks into off stump and Smith is on his way. He was moving around the crease a touch too much and the fuller delivery cuts back in to fool his front-foot drive on the up and makes him hear a sound every batsman hates",70/3,267192,10.3, b Woakes 5 (14m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.55,Steven Smith
"direct hit from the captain and Finch is gone! England are pumped up! He backed away to slap the ball past short cover, Morgan moved to his left, took aim and nailed the target. Finch was not even in the frame. MCG rises to celebrate a wonderful innings, but he was walking off cursing himself. Finch really could have enjoyed himself with over 10 overs left. Ends up fifth on the highest individual score by an Australian in the World Cup",216/4,5334,36.3,run out (Morgan) 135 (158m 128b 12x4 3x6) SR: 105.46,Aaron Finch
"oh, he's gone now! Drags it on and England have got rid of the set batsmen. The fatal slice to point against a good length ball outside off ends up an inside edge to knock middle stump. Good, solid innings from Bailey. Australia needed that.",228/5,4451,38.1, b Finn 55 (113m 69b 3x4 0x6) SR: 79.71,George Bailey
length ball has done the trick! Marsh holes out at long-off! The crowd roars it Root's ears as he settles beneath the miscued forehand-slam from the batsman and takes it comfortably,281/6,272450,45.1,c Root b Finn 23 (31m 20b 3x4 0x6) SR: 115.00,Mitchell Marsh
"swings and gets a thick outside edge that tests Broad at deep third man and he passes it with flying colours. Runs in, keeps his eyes all the way on it after Haddin looks for the boundary with a big slog as is necessary with only two balls left, he's played a little gem here",342/7,5560,49.4,c Broad b Finn 31 (23m 14b 5x4 0x6) SR: 221.42,Brad Haddin
"skews it down the ground and Root has taken an absolute blinder! It was full and speared in at the batsman's legs, credit to Maxwell to powering it that far down the ground but Root has made this wicket. Races to his right from long-off, dives full length and grabs it low with both hands. Text-book awesomeness!",342/8,325026,49.5,c Root b Finn 66 (63m 40b 11x4 0x6) SR: 165.00,Glenn Maxwell
"<b>at-trick for Finn, and a five- for</b>! That's a third time a bowler has been two-in-two today and Finn is the only one to convert. It was back of a length, Johnson backed away and slapped it straight at mid-off. Has a wry smile on his face and the reason is that Australia have piled up 342!",342/9,6033,49.6,c Anderson b Finn 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mitchell Johnson
