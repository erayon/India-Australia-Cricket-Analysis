"what a splendid catch that is from Shaun Marsh. A nothing delivery from Hastings, short and wide. Dhawna comes down and belts the cut in the air to deep point. He errs though and fails to keep it down. Shaun marsh runs around and leaps to take the ball over his head, both feet off the ground. And hold son despite landing hard. Is that what Australia need? Dhawan has thrown away a really really good start",123/1,28235,18.2,c SE Marsh b Hastings 78 (69m 56b 7x4 3x6) SR: 139.28,Shikhar Dhawan
"out! Big, big wicket this. Very full and wide from Hastings. Kohli goes for the expansive drive and gets a thin nick through to the keeper. Wade takes it over his head. Australia are a delighted bunch. Huge moment in the game",134/2,253802,20.2,c &dagger;Wade b Hastings 8 (11m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 72.72,Virat Kohli
"back of a length outside off, a bit of extra bounce, and Rohit goes for 99! It hurried through quicker than he expected, perhaps, as he looked to dab it towards third man, and he looks distraught when the caught behind appeal is upheld. Snicko shows the faintest of nicks, though.",231/3,34102,34.5,c &dagger;Wade b Hastings 99 (142m 108b 9x4 1x6) SR: 91.66,Rohit Sharma
"full and wide and Dhoni goes after it and holes out, Warner takes a simple catch running in from long-off. They cross over, however, and Pandey will be on strike",325/4,28081,49.2,c Warner b MR Marsh 34 (64m 42b 1x4 1x6) SR: 80.95,MS Dhoni
