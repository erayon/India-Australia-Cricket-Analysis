"gone this time! And Tahir sets off on his celebratory run. May have been the flipper, out the front of the hand. Short delivery, and quick on middle. Finch goes back, looks to cut, but clearly misjudged plenty in that - pace, length and shot selection. The ball skids through and beats Finch's cut to clatter into the stumps. Not nearly short enough to cut",72/1,5334,13.4, b Imran Tahir 19 (57m 40b 3x4 0x6) SR: 47.50,Aaron Finch
"<strong>two in three. </strong>SA's players run behind Tahir. Another wicket, another lovely show of deception. Again, fuller and quicker. No turn at all. Smith goes back, looks to drive but just plain misses a straight one. Smudge gone for nothing. Beats the batsman in a lack of flight and a change up in pace, literally.",72/2,267192,13.6, b Imran Tahir 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Steven Smith
"drags it back onto the stumps and the roar tells you the story. This is reward for accuracy. This one's bowled a touch fuller from the length area, Bailey is caught on the crease as he pokes tentatively away from the body. The BALL wobbles  wee bit to take the inside edge onto the stumps.",75/3,4451,16.2, b Phehlukwayo 2 (11m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25.00,George Bailey
"so the decision to persist with Rabada despite an ordinary last over has worked. And he's got the man who hit him for two sixes in the previous over. This one veers back in full from wide of the crease, Marsh looks to heave it across the line, more towards midwicket, but he swings too early as the ball deflects off the pad onto the stumps",139/4,272450,27.2, b Rabada 35 (43m 38b 2x4 2x6) SR: 92.10,Mitchell Marsh
"not all that short to pull but Head had decided he was going to go for it anyway, looked to fetch it from outside off too, and all he managed in the top was a top edge. It was swirling around for a long, long time but De Kock called nice and early, kept his eyes on it all along till he saw it lodge into his gloves.",229/5,530011,40.1,c &dagger;de Kock b Abbott 35 (62m 43b 4x4 0x6) SR: 81.39,Travis Head
"gets a big nick that is gleefully accepted by De Kock. This was a short of length delivery outside off, Wade went for a big swipe across the line but the extra bounce did him in.",248/6,230193,42.5,c &dagger;de Kock b Abbott 7 (13m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Matthew Wade
"as far as catches go, it can't get easier than that. Pacy length ball that holds up after pitching outside off, Mennie looks to loft through the line but hit it straight down the throat of Miller at mid-off. He impressed with the ball, but the outing with the bat has been anything but that",249/7,439288,43.2,c Miller b Rabada 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Joe Mennie
"what athleticism from Faf! Outstanding work to effect a run-out. In the end, Tremain has sacrificed his wicket. He got a thick inside edge towards midwicket where Phehlukwayo intially looked for an under-arm flick as the bowler was still on his followthrough. Faf wasn't even in the picture even as the flick came in. But he dived full-length across to nearly dive into the stumps. But he ensured he disturbed them only when he was fully in control of the ball. Top, top work",261/8,553800,44.3,run out (Phehlukwayo/du Plessis) 0 (7m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Chris Tremain
"Unfortunate end to a top, top knock. He simply had to come back for the second after carving that to deep cover, but the throw was right on top of the stumps from Tahir as de Kock gathered the ball cleanly and whipped the bails off. Newlands stand up to applaud a great innings.",288/9,219889,47.1,run out (Imran Tahir/&dagger;de Kock) 173 (218m 136b 24x4 0x6) SR: 127.20,David Warner
"tucked towards deep midwicket, the throw comes in full and flat as Steyn collects it cleanly and whips the bails off. Perhaps Boland's hit on the knee may have slowed him down as he turned for the second. <b> Third umpire has two looks before deciding it's 5-0 for South Africa. </b>",296/10,446548,48.2,run out (Rossouw/Steyn) 4 (9m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Scott Boland
