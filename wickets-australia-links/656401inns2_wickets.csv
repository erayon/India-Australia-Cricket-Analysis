"tried to force one too many, didn't pick the right ball, didn't pick the right bowler. Starc's been generating some serious pace, and this shortish ball reaches Moeen a bit too quickly. A mistimed pull shot lands in mid-on's hands",25/1,8917,4.4,c Bailey b Starc 10 (20m 13b 2x4 0x6) SR: 76.92,Moeen Ali
"trap set, trap sprung! It's a good length ball on middle, and it shapes in at him as well. Ballance can't help himself but go for a flick and he's picked out Finch at short midwicket",49/2,232438,9.4,c Finch b Marsh 10 (23m 13b 2x4 0x6) SR: 76.92,Gary Ballance
"speaking of Mitches... This was a slower, length ball and Bell has decided it had to go. Got onto the front foot and slogged it quite well. Only he forgot to calculate for Starc lurking on the midwicket boundary there",66/3,9062,13.4,c Starc b Marsh 36 (63m 45b 4x4 0x6) SR: 80.00,Ian Bell
two in two! And Marsh is sure pulling his weight! Becomes the fourth man on a hat-trick today as he gets Root to top-edge a short ball that Haddin tracks down around fine leg,66/4,303669,13.5,c &dagger;Haddin b Marsh 5 (20m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 41.66,Joe Root
"six balls, no runs, poor shot, Morgan's form appears to be like a mythical creature that just cannot be found. It's the slower short ball and he goes for a pull, can't adjust for the lack of pace, and gets a cue-end to Haddin, who dives to his left and forward as well to complete a spectacular grab",73/5,24598,17.6,c &dagger;Haddin b Marsh 0 (24m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Eoin Morgan
"Marsh has five, but this wicket is all Smith's! What a stunner at short cover! Forget Superman, just look at this guy leaping to his left and sticking out both hands that grapples a full-blooded bludgeon!",92/6,308967,21.2,c Smith b Marsh 10 (11m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 83.33,Jos Buttler
"slower ball outside off, lifted a bit too high into the air and well, don't bother it's Smith under it having back-pedalled from mid-off. So it's bound to be taken. Beaten for the lack of pace and England's fiesty resistance seems to be at an end",184/7,247235,35.2,c Smith b Johnson 37 (54m 42b 2x4 0x6) SR: 88.09,Chris Woakes
"first-baller and the stumps right up! Eight wickers down, all to the Mitches. And this was a yorker any fast bowler would he proud of! Ripped right through Broad's defences",194/8,10617,36.1, b Starc 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Stuart Broad
"Johnson v tailender... only one result! Vicious bouncer on middle, Finn appeared rooted, defends to protect himself and stared bemusedly at where the ball might have gone after it popped up off the splice. Mitch knew exactly where it was though as he runs up and takes the easiest of caught-and-bowleds",195/9,210283,37.1,c &amp; b Johnson 1 (4m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66,Steven Finn
"full and straight on middle and leg, Taylor looks for a flick and seems to have almost fallen over. Big appeal from the bowler, umpire Dar thinks and then gives it. Taylor immediately <b>reviews</b> it and it appears the ball might be skating down leg. Century still on the cards, it would seem. Funnily though, Aaron Finch had come up and started shaking hands with Taylor thinking the match was done. <b>But wait</b>, Dharmasena was checking for the run-out as the batsmen were looking to sneak a leg bye and it appears Maxwell has found his target to leave Anderson short of his ground. But how can that be considering Dar had given it out lbw and that means the ball should be dead, right? The question is, was he run out before the umpire's finger came up or was it after.... Taylor keeps telling it is dead ball, repeating it over and over, but Australia are already shaking hands and the umpires confirm that Anderson is indeed run out",231/10,8608,41.5,run out (Maxwell) 8 (26m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 72.72,James Anderson
