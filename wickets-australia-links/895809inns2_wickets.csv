"that's the Test world-record holder! Rahane has pulled off a blinder at long-off! This was another that Finch thought he could smoke over extra, and so he did. Except this time he had hit it in the air and gave that fielder a chance. Rahane moves swiftly to his left, eyes on the ball all the way, dives forward and grabs the ball inches from the turf. Brilliant",145/1,5334,24.5,c Rahane b Jadeja 71 (97m 81b 7x4 1x6) SR: 87.65,Aaron Finch
"hurries him, leading edge, taken by Kohli! That's the bowling leader India want, the man who can dismiss the set batsman. Marsh had set up for the clip through midwicket, but the shortish ball holds on the pitch and comes up with a bit too much height on it. He can't control the shot, he has lost his balance, he pops a high catch to short cover",166/2,6683,29.5,c Kohli b I Sharma 71 (121m 84b 5x4 0x6) SR: 84.52,Shaun Marsh
"zips through and topples off! There's the danger of showing off your stumps to a fast bowler. He had hit a cut shot off a delivery on middle against Ashwin, tried to repeat that against Yadav, who bowls it on a good length and gets the ball to skid through to beat his self-inflicted and limited defences",244/3,267192,40.5, b Yadav 46 (67m 47b 4x4 0x6) SR: 97.87,Steven Smith
