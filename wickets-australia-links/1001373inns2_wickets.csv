"the pressure has told. He was unable to get the ball off the square and has now fallen to the softest of dismissals. Looks to work it to the on side, but closed the bat face early and ends up chipping a simple return catch.",40/1,388802,5.4,c &amp; b Hazlewood 4 (25m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33,Tom Latham
"beautiful delivery! Pat Cummins with a huge wicket with a delivery that had serious pace. <b> 148.6kph </b>. This one was full, it came back in from wide of the crease and then held its line as Guptill's poke took the thinnest of edges on the way through to Wade. Special ball that.",52/2,226492,8.3,c &dagger;Wade b Cummins 45 (40m 33b 7x4 1x6) SR: 136.36,Martin Guptill
"Hazlewood returns and takes down Neesham. Good length and angling away outside off, from over the wicket, Neesham can't get under it as this isn't as full as he would have liked. Aims a loft, and ends up skewing a catch to Starc moving back from mid-off. Neesham falls for 74, his best List A score",177/3,355269,30.6,c Starc b Hazlewood 74 (93m 83b 7x4 1x6) SR: 89.15,James Neesham
"Holes out to long-on. Faulkner comes back and nabs Munro. Marsh completes a sprawling catch. Banged in short,  Munro commits to the front foot. Dares to pull and finds the fielder",191/4,232359,33.3,c Marsh b Faulkner 11 (14m 12b 1x4 1x6) SR: 91.66,Colin Munro
"edged and taken by Wade diving low to his right. Wide of the crease, very full and holds its line outside off. De Grandhomme does not move his feet, flashes a drive with his hands, and nicks behind. Excellent take from Wade",229/5,55395,38.4,c &dagger;Wade b Starc 12 (22m 14b 0x4 1x6) SR: 85.71,Colin de Grandhomme
"short and wide outside off, cutter, 121ks. Williamson cuts on the back foot, and does so early. He can't keep it down either. Warner pockets the overhead catch at extra cover. Australia close in",232/6,277906,39.1,c Warner b Cummins 81 (148m 80b 5x4 2x6) SR: 101.25,Kane Williamson
"144.5ks inswinging yorker from Starc. The result: Santner's stumps are left in a mess. Santner has a wild swish at it, but Starc is too quick for him",236/7,502714,40.5, b Starc 2 (12m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00,Mitchell Santner
"pace and bounce does the trick again. Southee was in no position to play a flat-batted pull. The ball got big on him, he was cramped for room and only managed to get a top edge to Bailey, who took a simple catch coming in from midwicket.",243/8,232364,41.5,c Bailey b Cummins 2 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Tim Southee
"hit well, but he's picked out the lone man at deep midwicket. Swung through the line to pull that short delivery, but it was almost as if he forgot there was a man in the deep. Nice, running catch from Faulkner. Ran to his left, was aware of the boundary behind him and pouched it safely. Hit and miss knock from Henry is over.",254/9,506612,45.1,c Faulkner b Cummins 7 (14m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 53.84,Matt Henry
"how fitting is it for Warner, the centurion, to take the catch? <b> Australia have taken the Chappell-Hadlee series. </b> Watling swings but doesn't get under that full delivery and ends up slicing it towards Warner, who circles around the ball briefly at cover, before settling underneath it to complete a comfortable catch.",262/10,38924,47.2,c Warner b Faulkner 17 (37m 22b 2x4 0x6) SR: 77.27,BJ Watling
