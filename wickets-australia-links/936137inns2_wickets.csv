"short ball, Finch scoops it straight up - bagged by Behardien at square leg! Done for pace, I suspect, looking to get on with it, as he had to, but the stroke was all sorts of wrong, hoicked up like a white flag and South Africa have their first",3/1,5334,1.2,c Behardien b Rabada 1 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00,Aaron Finch
"fired down leg, thick inside edge... WHADDACATCH!!! Steyn gets Smith, though he has de Kock to thank, he flew to his left to hold the chance one-handed, before tumbling and rising in delight to be mobbed by his team-mates. Smiffy's gotta go, via to a worldie from Quinny; the only thing that perhaps helped was that Steyn bowled it so far down leg he knew where he had to start moving early",29/2,267192,6.1,c &dagger;de Kock b Steyn 14 (21m 12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 116.66,Steven Smith
"bowled him, off stump pegged back! The pressure was building on Bailey and he went for the big shot, aiming down the ground but it wasn't quite there, seamed a fraction and he played around it as Parnell hit the bull's eye. Parnell then starts dabbing in celebration... that or he's short-circuiting",55/3,4451,10.6, b Parnell 9 (23m 18b 2x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,George Bailey
"... like I was saying ... down the leg side, bouncing alarming and catching the glove, and de Kock shuffles to his left to pouch the opportunity!",87/4,272450,16.1,c &dagger;de Kock b Parnell 19 (24m 19b 4x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Mitchell Marsh
"short and slammed to short midwicket, and that is the end of Warner! Duminy's golden arm strikes, it was dragged down and could have been dispatched to any corner of the Highveld. Instead, he finds Miller's bucket hands, and that is probably curtains for Australia's hopes!",114/5,219889,20.5,c Miller b Duminy 50 (93m 56b 7x4 1x6) SR: 89.28,David Warner
"rapped on the pad, that's a huge shout, and a long pause for thought for the umpire, but up goes the finger! Australia have <B>reviewed</B> and understandably so, this is vital. He's right across the stumps, and under the new DRS rules, this could be Umpire's Call ... indeed it is!",183/6,530011,30.6,lbw b Rabada 51 (59m 45b 5x4 2x6) SR: 113.33,Travis Head
"goes for the homer, maybe not short enough to pull, comes off the splice... and Duminy pouches it on the midwicket boundary! Two in four balls for SA and that probably puts the kibosh on Australia chasing from here",185/7,230193,31.3,c Duminy b Parnell 33 (46m 33b 5x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Matthew Wade
"...and it nearly is now, as the returning Imran Tahir slides one through Mennie's defence! Flat and quick from the leggie and it scuttles past a swish to leg, via an inside edge, to hit the top of off",204/8,439288,34.1, b Imran Tahir 1 (12m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00,Joe Mennie
"takes on the cutter, picks out deep midwicket! Hastings is off, a hasty swipe across the line, not as much pace on the ball for him to work with and it sails straight to the man on the fence, Australia nine down and all but done",213/9,228622,35.5,c Miller b Phehlukwayo 23 (25m 19b 1x4 2x6) SR: 121.05,John Hastings
"bowled 'im! Lucky breaks the stumps, quick and straight and Zampa played around it backing away, which means <b>South Africa win by a whopping 142 runs</b> with a dozen overs to spare",219/10,379504,37.4, b Phehlukwayo 8 (14m 11b 0x4 1x6) SR: 72.72,Adam Zampa
