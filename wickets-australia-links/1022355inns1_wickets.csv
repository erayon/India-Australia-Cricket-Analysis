"well, this was coming. Length ball, pushes across the batsman in the corridor. No feet from him again, a lazy feel for the ball and he gets a healthy edge through to Wade, who has to tumble to his left slightly",22/1,436677,5.2,c &dagger;Wade b Hazlewood 3 (24m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 27.27,Soumya Sarkar
"soft. But once again, it's the pace off the pitch that beats Kayes. This is back of a length and a but wide outside off stump, but too quick for him to get on the back foot. Looks to clobber it on the up, but offers a simple catch to cover point",37/2,280734,10.2,c Finch b Cummins 6 (23m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 37.50,Imrul Kayes
"similar delivery, better result for Australia! Angled in towards middle and off, a scrambled seam, skids into the pads and up goes the finger. That was very plumb indeed",53/3,56029,16.2,lbw b Henriques 9 (28m 20b 0x4 0x6) SR: 45.00,Mushfiqur Rahim
"Massive appeal, and up goes the finger! An instant <B>review</B> though from Shakib ... He was a long way forward, but it's given as umpire's call on impact, and the decision stays out!",122/4,56143,29.5,lbw b Head 29 (49m 48b 2x4 0x6) SR: 60.41,Shakib Al Hasan
"<b>he strikes!</b> Generously tossed up, full and wide. Sabbir has gotten out to better spin bowling than this. Gets to the pitch and drills the cover drive straight to Smith at extra cover",141/5,373538,34.2,c Smith b Zampa 8 (23m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14,Sabbir Rahman
"doesn't matter if that was out last ball, he's gifted him a wicket next ball. This is pushed through quick, back of a length and keeps a tad low. Mahmudullah makes room and looks to slap this through the off side, is only successful in chopping it onto the leg stump",153/6,56025,36.6, b Zampa 8 (10m 11b 0x4 1x6) SR: 72.72,Mahmudullah
"oh no, that's an unfortunate end to a good innings. It's that trademark one-legged whip again, but this time he closes the face too early. Wasn't a particularly menacing ball from Starc, short and at leg stump. The top edge carried neatly to long leg",181/7,56194,42.1,c Hazlewood b Starc 95 (175m 114b 6x4 3x6) SR: 83.33,Tamim Iqbal
"ta-dah! Full, fast, straight, and it's that sweet sound of the stumps being disturbed that Mortaza has probably grown up loving. But he's the batsman today",181/8,56007,42.3, b Starc 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Mashrafe Mortaza
"thanks for coming. Rubel appears to be shuddering before Starc releases the ball. Exposes the stumps and is met, predictably, by a full straight ball. Ambitious opening of the face brings him no result",181/9,300619,42.4, b Starc 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00,Rubel Hossain
"aaaaaaaand done. Starc has 4 off 9 balls. This is slightly short of being overpitched, but it tails away from Mehedi a touch. He wants to thump it on the up through the off side, but that's too quick",182/10,629063,44.3, b Starc 14 (36m 26b 1x4 0x6) SR: 53.84,Mehidy Hasan
