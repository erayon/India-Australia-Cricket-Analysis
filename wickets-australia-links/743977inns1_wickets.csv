"Rashid strikes as Burns hits a full toss straight back to him! Oh dear, Burns has fizzled out, spoilt for choice and he ended up slicing the ball down the track at waist height, Rashid happily accepting the gift to break a very decent opening stand",76/1,326632,14.3,c &amp; b Rashid 44 (61m 53b 5x4 0x6) SR: 83.01,Joe Burns
"he's got the breakthrough again! Credit to Morgan, as well as Rashid. Brave enough to toss the ball up, might have been a googly, Warner went for a drive and it skews off a thick outside edge to short third man",133/2,219889,26.2,c Woakes b Rashid 59 (108m 67b 6x4 0x6) SR: 88.05,David Warner
"another full toss, another wicket! Would you believe it! Smith is furious with himself. Was a juicy full toss, Smith was aiming to clear the deep midwicket boundary but couldn't get it wide, or over, Ben Stokes. That's a waste from the Australian captain",164/3,267192,30.6,c Stokes b Rashid 44 (62m 54b 3x4 1x6) SR: 81.48,Steven Smith
"and another! Excellent stuff from Rashid. A quicker ball, skids on and just grips a little, Bailey on the back foot aiming through the leg side, misses his shot and is struck on the back leg in front of middle. Nothing flukey about that one.",178/4,4451,32.2,lbw b Rashid 23 (22m 16b 1x4 1x6) SR: 143.75,George Bailey
"down the leg side, Maxwell flicks at it... does Buttler take the catch? Was there an edge? Joel Wilson raises his finger and, after some discussion between Maxwell, Watson and the umpires, the batsman heads off. The Big Show leaves the stage early, as replays confirm both the catch and a thin edge. Wood has a wicket, in slightly fortuitous circumstances",192/5,325026,35.3,c &dagger;Buttler b Wood 15 (22m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100.00,Glenn Maxwell
"pushed into the covers, Stokes swoops... and Watson is run out by a mile! What was Wade thinking?! Never a run there and Stokes only had to return the ball over the stumps, Buttler completed the job and Watson was barely ambling into shot",193/6,8180,36.6,run out (Stokes/&dagger;Buttler) 6 (22m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 54.54,Shane Watson
